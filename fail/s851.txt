                subject to the restriction set forth in this 
                subparagraph regarding the passage of water from the 
                Wellfield through the Reservation. Nothing in this 
                subsection shall affect the rights, if any, that Phelps 
                Dodge might claim regarding the flow of water in the 
                channel of Eagle Creek in the absence of this 
                subsection.
            ``(5) Past claims.--The Act does not address claims 
        relating to Phelps Dodge's prior occupancy and operation of the 
        Black River facilities. The Tribe agrees not to bring any such 
        claims against the United States. The Tribe also agrees that 
        within 30 days after Phelps Dodge has vacated the Reservation, 
        it shall dismiss with prejudice the suit that it has filed in 
        Tribal Court against Phelps Dodge (The San Carlos Apache Tribe 
        v. Phelps Dodge, et al., Case No. C-97-118), which such 
        dismissal shall not be considered a decision on the merits, and 
        any claims that it might assert against Phelps Dodge in 
        connection with Phelps Dodge's prior occupancy and operation of 
        the Black River facilities shall be brought exclusively in the 
        United States district court.
            ``(6) Relationship to settlement.--
                    ``(A) The term `Agreement', as defined by section 
                3703(2), shall not include Phelps Dodge.
                    ``(B) Section 3706(j) and section 3705(f) shall be 
                repealed and shall have no effect.
            ``(7) Ratification of settlement.--The agreement between 
        the San Carlos Apache Tribe, the Phelps Dodge Corporation, and 
        the Secretary of the Interior, as set forth in this subsection, 
        is hereby ratified and approved.''.
    (g) Technical Amendment.--Section 3702(a)(3) is amended by striking 
``qualification'' and inserting ``quantification''.
    Sec. 5004. Paragraph (5) of section 104(c) of the Marine Mammal 
Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 1374(c)(5)) is amended as follows:
            (1) In subparagraph (A), by striking ``, including polar 
        bears taken but not imported prior to the date of enactment of 
        the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 1994,''.
            (2) By adding the following new subparagraph at the end 
        thereof:
    ``(D) The Secretary of the Interior shall, expeditiously after the 
expiration of the applicable 30 day period under subsection (d)(2), 
issue a permit for the importation of polar bear parts (other than 
internal organs) from polar bears taken in sport hunts in Canada before 
the date of enactment of the Marine Mammal Protection Act Amendments of 
1994, to each applicant who submits, with the permit application, proof 
that the polar bear was legally harvested in Canada by the applicant. 
The Secretary shall issue such permits without regard to the provisions 
of subparagraphs (A) and (C)(ii) of this paragraph, subsection (d)(3) 
of this section, and sections 101 and 102. This subparagraph shall not 
apply to polar bear parts that were imported before the effective date 
of this subparagraph.''.
    Sec. 5005. (a) Findings.--The Congress finds that--
            (1) section 2477 of the Revised Statutes (R.S. 2477) was 
        repealed on October 21, 1976 by the Federal Land Policy and 
        Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.);
            (2) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act did not 
        terminate valid rights of way established under R.S. 2477 prior 
        to its repeal;
            (3) the Federal Land Policy and Management Act included 
        four provisions which explicitly preserved ``valid existing 
        rights'' and made the actions of the government ``subject to 
        valid existing rights'';
            (4) after the repeal of R.S. 2477, disagreement and 
        confusion has surrounded the existence and extent of rights of 
        way established under R.S. 2477;
            (5) in 1994 the Secretary of the Interior published 
        proposed regulations for processing claims regarding R.S. 2477 
        rights of way;
            (6) in 1995 and 1996 the Congress passed, and the President 
        enacted, three separate pieces of legislation that prevented 
        the Secretary of the Interior from finalizing those 
        regulations;
            (7) the Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations for Fiscal Year 
        1997 (Public Law 104-208) permanently prohibited the 
        promulgation of final rules or regulations regarding the 
        recognition, validity, or management of R.S. 2477 rights of way 
        unless such regulations were specifically authorized by a 
        subsequent Act of Congress;
            (8) the position of the Clinton Administration on this 
        issue is reflected in the written policy statement issued by 
        the Secretary of the Interior in January 1997 regarding R.S. 
        2477;
            (9) western State representatives strongly disagree with 
        the Administration's policy guidance; and
            (10) a process is needed to recommend expeditiously a 
        legislative mechanism to resolve all outstanding R.S. 2477 
        claims.
    (b) Process.--
            (1) Establishment of commission.--
                    (A) There is established a commission to be known 
                as the Commission on Section 2477 of the Revised 
                Statutes (hereinafter referred to in this section as 
                ``the Commission''). The Commission shall be composed 
                of 13 members, as follows:
                            (i) two officials from Federal land 
                        management agencies, which shall be the 
                        Secretary of the Interior and the Secretary of

                            (ii) six Members of Congress (or their 
                        staff designee), of whom two shall be appointed 
                        by the Majority Leader of the Senate and one by 
                        the Minority Leader of the Senate, and of whom 
                        two shall be appointed by the Speaker of the 
                        House of Representatives and one by the 
                        Minority Leader of the House of 
                        Representatives;
                            (iii) four State officials with land 
                        management or transportation development 
                        responsibilities, two of whom shall be from 
                        affected western States with a Republican 
                        Governor and two of whom shall be from affected 
                        western States with a Democratic Governor, with 
                        the four States selected by mutual agreement 
                        between the President, the Senate Majority 
                        Leader, and the Speaker of the House; and
                            (iv) a chairman, who shall be a former 
                        member of the Federal judiciary with experience 
                        in property and land management law, to be 
                        selected by consensus (or failing all 
                        reasonable attempts at consensus, majority 
                        vote) of the other 12 members of the 
                        Commission.
                    (B) The Commission shall be appointed within 90 
                days after the date of enactment of this section. The 
                Secretary of the Interior shall provide any necessary 
support to the Commission.
                    (C) The chairman of the Commission shall receive 
                compensation at the daily rate of GS-15, step 7 of the 
                General Schedule, when engaged in the actual 
                performance of duties for the Commission, and shall be 
                reimbursed for actual expenses in the performance of 
                such duties by the Secretary of the Interior. All other 
                members of the Commission shall be reimbursed and 
                compensated as appropriate by their respective 
                employers and shall not be considered Federal employees 
                solely because of their activities on the Commission.
                    (D) The Commission shall conduct its first meeting 
                no later than 120 days after the date of enactment of 
                this section, at which time the Commission shall select 
                by consensus or majority vote the chairman. The 
                Secretary of the Interior shall recommend to Commission 
                members the names of at least three persons who meet 
                the requirements of subparagraph (A)(iv) for 
                consideration at the first meeting. Any other member of 
                the Commission may also recommend persons who meet the 
                requirements of subparagraph (A)(iv) for the 
                consideration of the members at the first meeting.
            (2) Duties of commission.--
                    (A) The Commission shall recommend changes to law 
                that should be enacted to provide for an expeditious 
                resolution of all outstanding claims of a right of way 
                across Federal lands established pursuant to section 
                2477 of the Revised Statutes (43 U.S.C. 932).
                    (B) The Commission shall hold a public hearing in 
                each affected State upon the request of the Governor of 
                each such State, and shall consult with the Governor of 
                each affected State in developing its recommendations. 
                The Commission may hold such other hearings as it deems 
                necessary. All hearings conducted by the Commission 
                shall be open to the public, and notice of each hearing 
                shall be provided in media of general circulation 
                within the State at least 14 days prior to each such 
                hearing. The Secretary of the Interior shall publish a 
                public record of each hearing.
                    (C) The Commission shall make its recommendations 
                and all decisions by consensus, or failing all 
                reasonable attempts at consensus, by majority vote. The 
                Commission shall keep a record of its discussions. The 
                Commission may, by majority vote, open its meetings to 
                the public. If the Commission does conduct public 
                meetings, it shall provide public notice of the time 
                and place at least seven days in advance of each such 
                meeting.
                    (D) The Commission shall submit its recommendations 
                to the Secretary of the Interior by March 1, 1998. Not 
                later than 15 days prior to this date, the Commission 
                shall provide a draft of its recommendations to the 
                Governor of each affected State, and shall include any 
                letters submitted by such Governors with respect to 
                such recommendations as an appendix to the Commission's 
                submission to the Secretary of the Interior.
            (3) Review by secretary; submission to congress.--The 
        Secretary of the Interior shall review and either approve or 
        disapprove of the Commission's recommendations in their 
        entirety by March 31, 1998. If the Secretary of the Interior 
        approves of the Commission's recommendations, the Secretary 
        shall submit all of the Commission's recommendations to the 
        Committee on Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the 
Committee on Resources of the House of Representatives by April 1, 
1998. If the Secretary of the Interior disapproves of the Commission's 
recommendations, the Secretary shall state the reasons in writing for 
such disapproval and send a copy of such reasons with the Commission's 
recommendations to the Congress.
            (4) Congressional procedure.--
                    (A) Introduction.--The Chairman of the Committee on 
                Energy and Natural Resources of the Senate and the 
                Chairman of the Committee on Resources of the House of 
                Representatives (or their designees) shall introduce 
                the Commission's recommendations as a bill in their 
                respective Houses no later than 10 calendar days after 
                such recommendations are approved and submitted by the 
                Secretary of the Interior pursuant to paragraph (3). 
                The provisions of this paragraph hereinafter set forth 
                shall not apply to any bill containing the 
                recommendations of the Commission if the Secretary of 
                the Interior disapproves the Commission's 
                recommendations under paragraph (3).
                    (B) Consideration in the house.--
                            (i) Any committee of the House of 
                        Representatives to which a bill introduced 
                        pursuant to subsection (A) is referred shall 
                        report it, with or without amendment and with 
                        or without recommendation, not later than 60 
                        days of session after the date of such 
                        referral. If any committee fails to report the 
                        bill within that period, it is in order to move 
                        that the House discharge the committee from 
                        further consideration of the bill. A motion to 
                        discharge the bill may only be made by a member 
                        favoring the bill (but only at a time or place 
                        designated by the Speaker in the legislative 
                        schedule of the day after the calendar day on 
                        which the member offering the motion announces 
                        to the House his intention to do so and the 
                        form of the motion). The motion is highly 
                        privileged. Debate thereon shall be limited to 
                        not more than one hour, the time to be divided 
                        in the House equally between a proponent and 
                        opponent. The previous question shall be 
                        considered as ordered on the motion to its 
                        adoption without intervening motion. A motion 
                        to reconsider the vote by which the motion was 
                        agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
                        order.
                            (ii) After a bill introduced pursuant to 
                        subparagraph (A) is reported or a committee has 
                        been discharged from further consideration, it 
                        is in order to move that the House resolve into 
                        the Committee of the Whole House on the State 
                        of the Union for consideration of the bill. If 
                        reported and the report has been available for 
                        at least one calendar day, all points of order 
                        against the bill and against consideration of 
                        the bill are waived. If discharged, all points 
                        of order against the bill and against 
                        consideration of the bill are waived. The 
                        motion is highly privileged. A motion to 
                        reconsider the vote by which the motion was 
                        agreed to or disagreed to shall not be in 
                        order. During consideration of the bill in the 
                        Committee of the Whole, the first reading of 
                        the bill shall be dispensed with. General 
                        debate shall proceed, shall be confined to the 
                        bill, and shall not exceed four hours equally 
                        divided and controlled by a proponent and 
opponent of the bill. The bill shall be considered as read for 
amendment under the five-minute rule. Only one motion to rise shall be 
in order, except if offered by the manager. Consideration of the bill 
for amendment shall not exceed four hours excluding time for recorded 
votes and quorum calls. At the conclusion of the consideration of the 
bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the 
House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments 
thereto to final passage without intervening motion. A motion to 
reconsider the vote on passage of the bill shall not be in order.
                            (iii) Appeals from the decision of the 
                        Chair regarding application of the rules of the 
                        House of Representatives to the procedure 
                        relating to a bill introduced pursuant to 
                        subparagraph (A) shall be decided without 
                        debate.
                            (iv) It shall not be in order to consider 
                        under this subparagraph more than one bill 
                        introduced pursuant to subparagraph (A) except 
                        for consideration of a Senate bill introduced 
                        pursuant to subparagraph (A).
                    (C) Consideration in the senate.--
                            (i) A bill introduced pursuant to 
                        subparagraph (A) shall be referred to the 
                        appropriate committee or committees. A 
                        committee to which the bill is referred shall 
                        report the bill not later than 60 days of 
                        session after such referral. If any committee 
                        fails to report the bill within that period, 
                        that committee shall be automatically 
                        discharged from further consideration of the 
                        bill and the bill shall be placed on the 
                        calendar.
                            (ii) A motion to proceed to consideration 
                        of a bill introduced pursuant to subparagraph 
                        (A) and reported or automatically discharged

involving institutions for which the agency is the primary Federal 
regulator with respect to real property located within a disaster area 
pursuant to section 1123 of the Financial Institutions Reform,

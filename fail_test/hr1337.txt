To enhance the administrative authority of the respective presidents of 
     Haskell Indian Nations University and the Southwestern Indian 
             Polytechnic Institute, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Haskell Indian Nations University 
and Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute Administrative Systems 
Act of 1997''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds that--
            (1) the provision of culturally sensitive curricula for 
        higher education programs at Haskell Indian Nations University 
        and the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute is consistent 
        with the commitment of the Federal Government to the 
        fulfillment of treaty obligations to Indian tribes through the 
        principle of self-determination and the use of Federal 
        resources; and
            (2) giving a greater degree of autonomy to those 
        institutions, while maintaining them as an integral part of the 
        Bureau of Indian Affairs, will facilitate--
                    (A) the transition of Haskell Indian Nations 
                University to a 4-year university; and
                    (B) the administration and improvement of the 
                academic program of the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic 
                Institute.

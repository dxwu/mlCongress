SEC. 2. STATEMENT OF PURPOSE.

    The purposes of this Act are to--
            (1) restore the public confidence in and the integrity of 
        our democratic system;
            (2) strengthen and promote full and free discussion and 
        debate during election campaigns;
            (3) relieve Federal officeholders from limitations on their 
        attention to the affairs of the Federal government that can 
        arise from excessive attention to fundraising;
            (4) relieve elective office-seekers and officeholders from 
        the limitations on purposeful political conduct and discourse 
        that can arise from excessive attention to fundraising;
            (5) reduce corruption and undue influence, or the 
        appearance thereof, in the financing of Federal election 
        campaigns; and
            (6) provide non-preferential terms of access to elected 
        Federal officeholders by all interested members of the public 
        in order to uphold the constitutionally guaranteed right to 
        petition the Government for redress of grievances.

SEC. 3. FINDINGS OF FACT.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) The current Federal campaign finance system, with its 
        perceived preferential access to lawmakers for interest groups 
        capable of contributing sizable sums of money to lawmakers' 
        campaigns, has caused a widespread loss of public confidence in 
        the fairness and responsiveness of elective government and 
        undermined the belief, necessary to a functioning democracy, 
        that the Government exists to serve the needs of all people.
            (2) The United States Supreme Court, in Buckley v. Valeo, 
        424 U.S. 1 (1976), disapproved the use of mandatory spending 
        limits as a remedy for such effects, while approving the use of 
        campaign contribution limits.
            (3) Since that time, campaign expenditures have risen 
        steeply in Federal elections with spending by successful 
        candidates for the United States Senate between 1976 and 1996 
        rising from $609,100 to $3,775,000, an increase that is twice 
        the rate of inflation.
            (4) As campaign spending has escalated, voter turnout has 
        steadily declined and in 1996 voter turnout fell to its lowest 
        point since 1924, and stands now at the lowest level of any 
        democracy in the world.
            (5) Coupled with out-of-control campaign spending has come 
        the constant necessity of fundraising, arising, to a large 
        extent, from candidates adopting a defensive ``arms race'' 
        posture of constant readiness against the risk of massively 
        financed attacks against whatever the candidate may say or do.
            (6) The current campaign finance system has had a 
        deleterious effect on those who hold public office as endless 
        fundraising pressures intrude upon the performance of 
        constitutionally required duties. Capable and dedicated 
officials have left office in dismay over these distractions and the 
negative public perceptions that the fundraising process engenders and 
numerous qualified citizens have declined to seek office because of the 
prospect of having to raise the extraordinary amounts of money needed 
in today's elections.
            (7) The requirement for candidates to fundraise, the 
        average 1996 expenditure level required a successful Senate 
        candidate to raise more than $12,099 a week for 6 years, 
        significantly impedes on the ability of Senators and other 
        officeholders to tend to their official duties, and limits the 
        ability of candidates to interact with the electorate while 
        also tending to professional responsibilities.
            (8) As talented incumbent and potential public servants are 
        deterred from seeking office in Congress because of such 
        fundraising pressures, the quality of representation suffers 
        and those who do serve are impeded in their effort to devote 
        full attention to matters of the Government by the campaign 
        financing system.
            (9) Contribution limits are inadequate to control all of 
        these trends and as long as campaign spending is effectively 
        unrestrained, supporters can find ways to protect their favored 
        candidates from being outspent. Since 1976 major techniques 
        have been found and exploited to get around and evade 
        contribution limits.
            (10) Techniques to evade contribution limits include 
        personal spending by wealthy candidates, independent 
        expenditures that assist or attack an identified candidate, 
        media campaigns by corporations, labor unions, and nonprofit 
        organizations to advocate the election or defeat of candidates, 
        and the use of national, State, or local political parties as a 
        conduit for money that assists or attacks such candidates.
            (11) Wealthy candidates may, under the present Federal 
        campaign financing system, spend any amount they want out of 
        their own resources and while such spending may not be self-
        corrupting, it introduces the very defects the Supreme Court 
        wants to avoid. The effectively limitless character of such 
        resources obliges a wealthy candidate's opponent to reach for 
        larger amounts of outside support, causing the deleterious 
        effects previously described.
            (12) Experience shows that there is an identity of interest 
        between candidates and political parties because the parties 
        exist to support candidates, not the other way around. Party 
        expenditures in support of, or in opposition to, an 
        identifiable candidate are, therefore, effectively spending on 
        behalf of a candidate.
            (13) Political experience shows that so-called 
        ``independent'' support, whether by individuals, committees, or 
        other entities, can be and often is coordinated with a 
        candidate's campaign by means of tacit understandings without 
        losing its nominally independent character and, similarly, 
        contributions to a political party, ostensibly for ``party-
        building'' purposes, can be and often are routed, by undeclared 
        design, to the support of identified candidates.
            (14) The actual, case-by-case detection of coordination 
        between candidate, party, and independent contributor is, as a 
        practical matter, impossible in a fast-moving campaign 
        environment.
            (15) So-called ``issue advocacy'' communications, by or 
        through political parties or independent contributors, need 
        not, as a practical matter, advocate expressly for the election 
        or defeat of a named candidate in order to cross the line into 
        election campaign advocacy; any clear, objective indication of 
        purpose, such that voters may readily observe where their 
        electoral support is invited, can suffice as evidence of intent 
        to impact a Federal election campaign.
            (16) When State political parties or other entities 
        operating under State law receive funds, often called ``soft 
        money'', for use in Federal elections, they become de facto 
        agents of the national political party and the inclusion of 
        these funds under applicable Federal limitations is necessary 
        and proper for the effective regulation of Federal election 
        campaigns.
            (17) The exorbitant level of money in the political system 
        has served to distort our democracy by giving some 
        contributors, who constitute less than 3 percent of the 
        citizenry, the appearance of favored access to elected 
        officials, thus undermining the ability of ordinary citizens to 
        petition their Government. Concerns over the potential for 
        corruption and undue influence, and the appearances thereof, 
        has left citizens cynical, the reputation of elected officials 
        tarnished, and the moral authority of Government weakened.
            (18) The 2 decades of experience since the Supreme Court's 
        Buckley v. Valeo ruling in 1976 have made it evident that 
        reasonable limits on election campaign expenditures are now 
        necessary and these limits must comprehensively address all 
types of expenditures to prevent circumvention of such limits.
            (19) The Supreme Court based its Buckley v. Valeo decision 
        on a concern that spending limits could narrow political speech 
        ``by restricting the number of issues discussed, the depth of 
        their exploration, and the size of the audience reached''. The 
        experience of the past 20 years has been otherwise as 
        experience shows that unlimited expenditures can drown out or 
        distort political discourse in a flood of distractive 
        repetition. Reasonable spending limits will increase the 
        opportunity for previously muted voices to be heard and thereby 
        increase the number, depth, and diversity of ideas presented to 
        the public.
            (20) Issue advocacy communications that do not promote or 
        oppose an identified candidate should remain unregulated, as 
        should the traditional freedom of the press to report and 
        editorialize about candidates and campaigns.
            (21) In establishing reasonable limits on campaign 
        spending, it is necessary that the limits reflect the realities 
        of modern campaigning in a large, diverse population with 
        sophisticated and expensive modes of communication. The limits 
        must allow citizens to benefit from a full and free debate of 
        issues and permit candidates to garner the resources necessary 
        to engage in that debate.
            (22) The expenditure limits established in this Act for 
        election to the United States Senate were determined after 
        careful review of historical spending patterns in Senate 
        campaigns as well as the particular spending level of the 3 
        most recent elections as evidenced by the following:
                    (A) The limit formula allows candidates a level of 
                spending which guarantees an ability to disseminate 
                their message by accounting for the size of the 
                population in each State as well as historical spending 
                trends including the demonstrated trend of lower 
                campaign spending per voter in larger States as 
                compared to voter spending in smaller States.
                    (B) The candidate expenditure limits included in 
                this legislation would have restricted 80 percent of 
                the incumbent candidates in the last 3 elections, while 
                only impeding 18 percent of the challengers.
                    (C) It is clear from recent experience that 
                expenditure limits as set by the formula in this Act 
                will be high enough to allow an effective level of 
                competition, encourage candidate dialogue with 
                constituents, and circumscribe the most egregiously 
                high spending levels, so as to be a bulwark against 
                future campaign finance excesses and the resulting 
                voter disenfranchisement.

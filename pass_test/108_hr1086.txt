  TITLE I--STANDARDS DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION ADVANCEMENT ACT OF 2004

SEC. 101. SHORT TITLE.

    This title may be cited as the ``Standards Development Organization 
Advancement Act of 2004''.

SEC. 102. FINDINGS.

    The Congress finds the following:
        (1) In 1993, the Congress amended and renamed the National 
    Cooperative Research Act of 1984 (now known as the National 
    Cooperative Research and Production Act of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301 et 
    seq.)) by enacting the National Cooperative Production Amendments 
    of 1993 (Public Law 103-42) to encourage the use of collaborative, 
    procompetitive activity in the form of research and production 
    joint ventures that provide adequate disclosure to the antitrust 
    enforcement agencies about the nature and scope of the activity 
    involved.
        (2) Subsequently, in 1995, the Congress in enacting the 
    National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 
    272 note) recognized the importance of technical standards 
    developed by voluntary consensus standards bodies to our national 
    economy by requiring the use of such standards to the extent 
    practicable by Federal agencies and by encouraging Federal agency 
    representatives to participate in ongoing standards development 
    activities. The Office of Management and Budget on February 18, 
    1998, revised Circular A-119 to reflect these changes made in law.
        (3) Following enactment of the National Technology Transfer and 
    Advancement Act of 1995, technical standards developed or adopted 
    by voluntary consensus standards bodies have replaced thousands of 
    unique Government standards and specifications allowing the 
    national economy to operate in a more unified fashion.
        (4) Having the same technical standards used by Federal 
    agencies and by the private sector permits the Government to avoid 
    the cost of developing duplicative Government standards and to more 
    readily use products and components designed for the commercial 
    marketplace, thereby enhancing quality and safety and reducing 
    costs.
        (5) Technical standards are written by hundreds of nonprofit 
    voluntary consensus standards bodies in a nonexclusionary fashion, 
    using thousands of volunteers from the private and public sectors, 
    and are developed under the standards development principles set 
    out in Circular Number A-119, as revised February 18, 1998, of the 
    Office of Management and Budget, including principles that require 
    openness, balance, transparency, consensus, and due process. Such 
    principles provide for--
            (A) notice to all parties known to be affected by the 
        particular standards development activity,
            (B) the opportunity to participate in standards development 
        or modification,
            (C) balancing interests so that standards development 
        activities are not dominated by any single group of interested 
        persons,
            (D) readily available access to essential information 
        regarding proposed and final standards,
            (E) the requirement that substantial agreement be reached 
        on all material points after the consideration of all views and 
        objections, and
            (F) the right to express a position, to have it considered, 
        and to appeal an adverse decision.
        (6) There are tens of thousands of voluntary consensus 
    standards available for government use. Most of these standards are 
    kept current through interim amendments and interpretations, 
    issuance of addenda, and periodic reaffirmation, revision, or 
    reissuance every 3 to 5 years.
        (7) Standards developed by government entities generally are 
    not subject to challenge under the antitrust laws.
        (8) Private developers of the technical standards that are used 
    as Government standards are often not similarly protected, leaving 
    such developers vulnerable to being named as codefendants in 
    lawsuits even though the likelihood of their being held liable is 
    remote in most cases, and they generally have limited resources to 
    defend themselves in such lawsuits.
        (9) Standards development organizations do not stand to benefit 
    from any antitrust violations that might occur in the voluntary 
    consensus standards development process.
        (10) As was the case with respect to research and production 
    joint ventures before the passage of the National Cooperative 
    Research and Production Act of 1993, if relief from the threat of 
    liability under the antitrust laws is not granted to voluntary 
    consensus standards bodies, both regarding the development of new 
    standards and efforts to keep existing standards current, such 
    bodies could be forced to cut back on standards development 
    activities at great financial cost both to the Government and to 
    the national economy.

SEC. 103. DEFINITIONS.

    Section 2 of the National Cooperative Research and Production Act 
of 1993 (15 U.S.C. 4301) is amended--

SEC. 221. PUBLIC INTEREST DETERMINATION.

    (a) Congressional Findings and Declaration of Purposes.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (A) the purpose of the Tunney Act was to ensure that the 
        entry of antitrust consent judgments is in the public interest; 
        and
            (B) it would misconstrue the meaning and Congressional 
        intent in enacting the Tunney Act to limit the discretion of 
        district courts to review antitrust consent judgments solely to 
        determining whether entry of those consent judgments would make 
        a ``mockery of the judicial function''.
        (2) Purposes.--The purpose of this section is to effectuate the 
    original Congressional intent in enacting the Tunney Act and to 
    ensure that United States settlements of civil antitrust suits are 
    in the public interest.
    (b) Public Interest Determination.--Section 5 of the Clayton Act 
(15 U.S.C. 16) is amended--
        (1) in subsection (d), by inserting at the end the following: 
    ``Upon application by the United States, the district court may, 
    for good cause (based on a finding that the expense of publication 
    in the Federal Register exceeds the public interest benefits to be 
    gained from such publication), authorize an alternative method of 
    public dissemination of the public comments received and the 
    response to those comments.'';
        (2) in subsection (e)--
            (A) in the matter before paragraph (1), by--
                (i) striking ``court may'' and inserting ``court 
            shall''; and
                (ii) inserting ``(1)'' before ``Before''; and
            (B) striking paragraphs (1) and (2) and inserting the 
        following:
        ``(A) the competitive impact of such judgment, including 
    termination of alleged violations, provisions for enforcement and 
    modification, duration of relief sought, anticipated effects of 
    alternative remedies actually considered, whether its terms are 
    ambiguous, and any other competitive considerations bearing upon 
    the adequacy of such judgment that the court deems necessary to a 
    determination of whether the consent judgment is in the public 
    interest; and
        ``(B) the impact of entry of such judgment upon competition in 
    the relevant market or markets, upon the public generally and 
    individuals alleging specific injury from the violations set forth 
    in the complaint including consideration of the public benefit, if 
    any, to be derived from a determination of the issues at trial.
    ``(2) Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the 
court to conduct an evidentiary hearing or to require the court to 
permit anyone to intervene.''; and
        (3) in subsection (g), by inserting ``by any officer, director, 
    employee, or agent of such defendant'' before ``, or other 
    person''.

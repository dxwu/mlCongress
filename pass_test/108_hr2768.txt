SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    The Congress hereby finds as follows:
        (1) John Marshall served as the Chief Justice of the United

    virtually all of the most important cases decided by the Supreme 
    Court during his tenure.
        (3) Under his leadership, the Supreme Court of the United 
    States gave shape to the fundamental principles of the 
    Constitution, most notably the principle of judicial review.
        (4) John Marshall's service to the United States--not only as a 
    Chief Justice, but also as a soldier in the Revolutionary War, as a 
    Member of Congress, and as Secretary of State--truly makes him one 
    of the most important figures in our Nation's history.

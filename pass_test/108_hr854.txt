                                 An Act


 
To provide for the promotion of democracy, human rights, and rule of law 
 in the Republic of Belarus and for the consolidation and strengthening 
                of Belarus sovereignty and independence.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Belarus Democracy Act of 2004''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The United States supports the promotion of democracy, 
    respect for human rights, and the rule of law in the Republic of 
    Belarus consistent with its commitments as a participating state of 
    the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE).
        (2) The United States has a vital interest in the independence 
    and sovereignty of the Republic of Belarus and its integration into 
    the European community of democracies.
        (3) In November 1996, Lukashenka orchestrated an illegal and 
    unconstitutional referendum that enabled him to impose a new 
    constitution, abolish the duly-elected parliament, the 13th Supreme 
    Soviet, install a largely powerless National Assembly, and extend 
    his term of office to 2001.
        (4) Democratic forces in Belarus have organized peaceful 
    demonstrations against the Lukashenka regime in cities and towns 
    throughout Belarus which led to beatings, mass arrests, and 
    extended incarcerations.
        (5) Victor Gonchar, Anatoly Krasovsky, and Yuri Zakharenka, who 
    have been leaders and supporters of the democratic forces in 
    Belarus, and Dmitry Zavadsky, a journalist known for his critical 
    reporting in Belarus, have disappeared and are presumed dead.
        (6) Former Belarus Government officials have come forward with 
    credible allegations and evidence that top officials of the 
    Lukashenka regime were involved in the disappearances.
        (7) The Belarusian authorities have mounted a major systematic 
    crackdown on civil society through the closure, harassment, and 
    repression of nongovernmental organizations, and independent trade 
    unions.
        (8) The Belarusian authorities actively suppress freedom of 
    speech and expression, including engaging in systematic reprisals 
    against independent media.
        (9) The Lukashenka regime has reversed the revival of 
    Belarusian language and culture, including through the closure of 
    the National Humanities Lyceum, the last remaining high school 
    where classes were taught in the Belarusian language.
        (10) The Lukashenka regime harasses the autocephalic Belarusian 
    Orthodox Church, the Roman Catholic Church, the Jewish community, 
    the Hindu Lights of Kalyasa community, evangelical Protestant 
    churches (such as Baptist and Pentecostal groups), and other 
    minority religious groups.
        (11) The Law on Religious Freedom and Religious Organizations, 
    passed by the National Assembly and signed by Lukashenka on October 
    31, 2002, establishes one of the most repressive legal regimes in 
    the OSCE region, severely limiting religious freedom and placing 
    excessively burdensome government controls on religious practice.
        (12) The parliamentary elections of October 15, 2000, and the 
    presidential election of September 9, 2001, were determined to be 
    fundamentally unfair and nondemocratic.
        (13) The Government of Belarus has made no substantive progress 
    in addressing criteria established by the OSCE in 2000, ending 
    repression and the climate of fear, permitting a functioning 
    independent media, ensuring transparency of the elections process, 
    and strengthening of the functions of parliament.

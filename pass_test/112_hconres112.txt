                            TITLE VI--POLICY

SEC. 601. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 50 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
        their health security.
            (2) The Medicare Trustees Report has repeatedly recommended 
        that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed 
        soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of 
        Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in and 
        near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the 
        Congressional Budget Office--
                    (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted in 2022 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; 
                and
                    (B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the 
                economy and Medicare outlays are currently rising at a 
                rate of 6.3 percent per year, and under the 
                Congressional Budget Office's alternative fiscal 
                scenario, direct spending on Medicare is projected to 
                reach 7 percent of GDP by 2035 and 14 percent of GDP by 
                2085.
            (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
        American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
        generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending 
        levels that cannot be sustained.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution 
to protect those in and near retirement from any disruptions to their 
Medicare benefits and offer future beneficiaries the same health care 
options available to Members of Congress.
    (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare 
program such that:
            (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in 
        and near retirement, without changes.
            (2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, 
        Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and a 
        selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which 
        recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.
            (3) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-
        income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.
            (4) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
        Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.

SEC. 602. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 55 million retirees, individuals with 
        disabilities, and survivors depend on Social Security. Since 
        enactment, Social Security has served as a vital leg on the 
        ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which includes 
        employer provided pensions as well as personal savings.
            (2) The Social Security Trustees report has repeatedly 
        recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
        challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the 
        financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious 
        and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security 
        disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
                    (A) In 2016, according to the Congressional Budget 
                Office, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust Fund 
                will be exhausted and will be unable to pay scheduled 
                benefits.
                    (B) In 2036, according to the Social Security 
                Trustees Report the combined Federal Old-Age and 
                Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability 
                Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted, and will be 
                unable to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (C) With the exhaustion of the trust funds in 2036, 
                benefits will be cut 23 percent across the board, 
                devastating those currently in or near retirement and 
                those who rely on Social Security the most.
            (3) The current recession has exacerbated the crisis to 
        Social Security. The Congressional Budget Office continues to 
        project permanent cash deficits.
            (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a 
        larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, 
        reforms should take into consideration the need to protect 
        lower-income Americans' retirement security.
            (5) Americans deserve action by their elected officials on 
        Social Security reform. It is critical that the Congress and 
        the administration work together in a bipartisan fashion to 
        address the looming insolvency of Social Security. In this 
        spirit, this resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to 
        find solutions by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social 
        Security remains a critical part fo the safety net.
    (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this resolution 
that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security 
permanently solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law 
trigger, such that--
            (1)(A) if in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal 
        Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal 
        Disability Insurance Trust Fund in its annual Trustees' Report 
        determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social 
        Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of 
        the Social Security Trust Funds in the 75th year is in deficit, 
        the Board of Trustees should, not later than September 30 of 
        the same calendar year, submit to the President recommendations 
        for statutory reforms necessary to achieve a positive 75-year 
        actuarial balance and a positive annual balance in the 75th 
        year; and
            (B) such recommendations provided to the President should 
        be agreed upon by both Public Trustees of the Board of 
        Trustees;
            (2)(A) not later than December 1 of the same calendar year 
        in which the Board of Trustees submits its recommendations, the 
        President shall promptly submit implementing legislation to 
        both Houses of Congress, including recommendations necessary to 
        achieve a positive 75-year actuarial balance and a positive 
        annual balance in the 75th year; and
            (B) the Majority Leader of the Senate and the Majority 
        Leader of the House should introduce such legislation upon 
        receipt;
            (3) within 60 days of the President submitting legislation, 
        the committees of jurisdiction to which the legislation has 
        been referred should report such legislation, which should be 
        considered by the full House or Senate under expedited 
        procedures; and
            (4) legislation submitted by the President should--
                    (A) protect those in and near retirement;
                    (B) preserve the safety net for those who rely on 
                Social Security, including survivors and those with 
                disabilities;
                    (C) improve fairness for participants; and
                    (D) reduce the burden on, and provide certainty 
                for, future generations.

SEC. 603. POLICY STATEMENT ON DEFICIT REDUCTION THROUGH THE 
              CANCELLATION OF UNOBLIGATED BALANCES.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) According to the Office of Management and Budget, 
        Federal agencies will hold $698 billion in unobligated balances 
        at the close of fiscal year 2013.
            (2) These funds represent direct and discretionary spending 
        made available by Congress that remain available for 
        expenditure beyond the fiscal year for which they are provided.
            (3) In some cases, agencies are granted funding and it 
        remains available for obligation indefinitely.
            (4) The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
        1974 requires the Office of Management and Budget to make funds 
        available to agencies for obligation and prohibits the 
        Administration from withholding or cancelling unobligated funds 
        unless approved by an act of Congress.
            (5) Greater congressional oversight is required to review 
        and identify potential savings from unneeded balances of funds.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Cancellation of 
Unobligated Balances.--Congressional committees shall through their 
oversight activities identify and achieve savings through the 
cancellation or rescission of unobligated balances that neither 
abrogate contractual obligations of the Federal Government nor reduce 
or disrupt Federal commitments under programs such as Social Security, 
veterans' affairs, national security, and Treasury authority to finance 
the national debt.
    (c) Deficit Reduction.--Congress, with the assistance of the 
Government Accountability Office, the Inspectors General, and other 
appropriate agencies should make it a high priority to review 
unobligated balances and identify savings for deficit reduction.

SEC. 604. RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ELIMINATION OF WASTE, FRAUD, AND 
              ABUSE IN FEDERAL PROGRAMS.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The Government Accountability Office is required by law 
        to identify examples of waste, duplication, and overlap in 
        Federal programs, and has so identified dozens of such 
        examples.
            (2) In testimony before the Committee on Oversight and 
        Government Reform, the Comptroller General has stated that 
        addressing the identified waste, duplication, and overlap in 
        Federal programs ``could potentially save tens of billions of 
        dollars''.
            (3) The Rules of the House of Representatives require each 
        standing committee to hold at least one hearing every four 
        months on waste, fraud, abuse, or mismanagement in Government 
        programs.
            (4) The findings resulting from congressional oversight of 
        Federal Government programs should result in programmatic 
        changes in both authorizing statutes and program funding 
        levels.
    (b) Policy on Deficit Reduction Through the Reduction of 
Unnecessary and Wasteful Spending.--Each authorizing committee annually 
shall include in its Views and Estimates letter required under section 
301(d) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 recommendations to the 
Committee on the Budget of programs within the jurisdiction of such 
committee whose funding should be reduced or eliminated. Such 
recommendations shall be made publicly available.

                TITLE VII--SENSE OF THE HOUSE PROVISIONS

SEC. 701. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD SUPPORT 
              ENFORCEMENT.

    It is the sense of the House that--
            (1) additional legislative action is needed to ensure that 
        States have the necessary resources to collect all child 
        support that is owed to families and to allow them to pass 100 
        percent of support on to families without financial penalty; 
        and
            (2) when 100 percent of child support payments are passed 
        to the child, rather than administrative expenses, program 
        integrity is improved and child support participation 
        increases.

            Passed the House of Representatives March 29, 2012.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.

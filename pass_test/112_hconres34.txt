            (I) the budgetary effects of measures reforming the tax 
        code and lowering tax rates.
    (2) A measure does not qualify for adjustments under paragraph

SEC. 405. LIMITATION ON LONG-TERM SPENDING.

    (a) In General.--In the House, it shall not be in order to consider

                            TITLE V--POLICY

SEC. 501. POLICY STATEMENT ON MEDICARE.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 46 million Americans depend on Medicare for 
        their health security.
            (2) The Medicare Trustees report has repeatedly recommended 
        that Medicare's long-term financial challenges be addressed 
        soon. Each year without reform, the financial condition of 
        Medicare becomes more precarious and the threat to those in and 
        near retirement becomes more pronounced. According to the 
        Congressional Budget Office--
                    (A) the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund will be 
                exhausted in 2020 and unable to pay scheduled benefits; 
                and
                    (B) Medicare spending is growing faster than the 
                economy. Medicare outlays are currently rising at a 
                rate of 7.2 percent per year, and under CBO's 
                alternative fiscal scenario, mandatory spending on 
                Medicare is projected to reach 7 percent of GDP by 2035 
                and 14 percent of GDP by 2080.
            (3) Failing to address this problem will leave millions of 
        American seniors without adequate health security and younger 
        generations burdened with enormous debt to pay for spending 
        levels that cannot be sustained.
    (b) Policy on Medicare Reform.--It is the policy of this resolution 
to protect those in and near retirement from any disruptions to their 
Medicare benefits and offer future beneficiaries the same health care 
options available to Members of Congress.
    (c) Assumptions.--This resolution assumes reform of the Medicare 
program such that:
            (1) Current Medicare benefits are preserved for those in 
        and near retirement, without changes.
            (2) For future generations, when they reach eligibility, 
        Medicare is reformed to provide a premium support payment and a 
        selection of guaranteed health coverage options from which 
        recipients can choose a plan that best suits their needs.
            (3) Medicare will provide additional assistance for lower-
        income beneficiaries and those with greater health risks.
            (4) Medicare spending is put on a sustainable path and the 
        Medicare program becomes solvent over the long-term.

SEC. 502. POLICY STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) More than 50 million retirees and individuals with a 
        disability depend on Social Security for a key part of their 
        income. Since enactment, Social Security has served as a vital 
        leg on the ``three-legged stool'' of retirement security, which 
        includes employer provided pensions as well as personal 
        savings.
            (2) The Social Security Trustees report has repeatedly 
        recommended that Social Security's long-term financial 
        challenges be addressed soon. Each year without reform, the 
        financial condition of Social Security becomes more precarious 
        and the threat to seniors and those receiving Social Security 
        disability benefits becomes more pronounced:
                    (A) In 2018, the Federal Disability Insurance Trust 
                Fund will be exhausted and will be unable to pay 
                scheduled benefits.
                    (B) In 2037, the combined Federal Old-Age and 
                Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and Federal Disability 
                Insurance Trust Fund will be exhausted, and will be 
                unable to pay scheduled benefits.
                    (C) With the exhaustion of the Trust Funds in 2037, 
                benefits will be cut 22 percent across the board, 
                devastating those currently in or near retirement and 
                those who rely on Social Security the most.
            (3) The current recession has exacerbated the crisis to 
        Social Security. The most recent CBO projections find that 
        Social Security has entered into permanent cash deficits.
            (4) Lower-income Americans rely on Social Security for a 
        larger proportion of their retirement income. Therefore, 
        reforms should take into consideration the need to protect 
        lower-income Americans' retirement security.
            (5) Americans deserve action by their elected officials on 
        Social Security reform. It is critical that the Congress and 
        the administration work together in a bipartisan fashion to 
        address the looming insolvency of Social Security. In this 
        spirit, this resolution creates a bipartisan opportunity to 
        find solutions by requiring policymakers to ensure that Social 
        Security remains a critical part fo the safety net.
    (b) Policy on Social Security.--It is the policy of this resolution 
that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security 
permanently solvent. This resolution assumes reform of a current law 
trigger, such that--
            (1)(A) if in any year the Board of Trustees of the Federal 
        Old-Age and Survivors Insurance Trust Fund and the Federal 
        Disability Insurance Trust Fund in its annual Trustees' Report 
        determines that the 75-year actuarial balance of the Social 
        Security Trust Funds is in deficit, and the annual balance of

SEC. 503. POLICY STATEMENT ON BUDGET ENFORCEMENT.

    (a) Findings.--The House finds the following:
            (1) The President's fiscal year 2012 budget requests a $13 
        trillion increase in the debt subject to limit over the period 
        of years covered by the budget.
            (2) Under the President's fiscal year 2012 budget, 
        according to the Congressional Budget Office, debt held by the 
        public will rise to 69 percent of gross domestic product in 
        2011 and will reach 87.4 percent of gross domestic product by 
        2021.
            (3) The Congressional Budget Office, the Federal Reserve, 
        the General Accountability Office, the President's National 
        Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, and ten former 
        Chairmen of the Council of Economic Advisors all concluded that 
        debt is growing at unsustainable rates and must be brought 
        under control.
            (4) Admiral Mike Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
        Staff, stated, ``Our national debt is our biggest national 
        security threat.''.
            (5) According to the Congressional Budget Office, if 
        entitlements are not reformed, entitlement spending on Social 
        Security, Medicare, and Medicaid will exceed the historical 
        average of revenue collections as a share of the economy within 
        forty years.
            (6) According to the Congressional Budget Office, under 
        current policies, debt would reach levels that the economy 
        could no longer sustain in 2037 and a fiscal crisis is likely 
        to occur well before that date.
            (7) To avoid a fiscal crisis, Congress must enact 
        legislation that makes structural reforms to entitlement 
        programs.
            (8) Instead of automatic debt increases (the ``Gephardt 
        rule'' was repealed by the House in House Resolution 5) and 
        automatic spending increases, Congress needs to put limits on 
        spending with automatic reductions if spending limits are not 
        met.
            (9) The adoption of a conference report on this concurrent 
        resolution will not cause the automatic passage of an increase 
        in the debt limit by the House of Representatives.
            (10) Changes in debt levels assumed in this resolution are 
        contingent upon its proposed spending reductions being 
        achieved.
            (11) From 1990 to 2002, there were statutory enforceable 
        limits on discretionary spending.
            (12) The budget lacks controls over spending in the short-
        term and the long-term. Greater transparency and controls, 
        particularly for entitlement spending in the long-term, are 
        needed to provide Congress with tools to tackle this growing 
        threat of a fiscal crisis.
    (b) Policy on Debt Controls.--It is the policy of this concurrent 
resolution on the budget that in order to begin to bring debt under 
control the following statutory spending and debt controls are needed:
            (1) Enforceable statutory caps on discretionary spending at 
        levels set forth in this fiscal year 2012 concurrent resolution 
        on the budget for the period of fiscal years 2012 through 2021.
            (2) Any increase in the statutory debt limit be accompanied 
        by the enactment of a budget enforcement mechanism to ensure 
        that if spending reductions are not achieved there would be--
                    (A) an across-the-board reduction in spending at 
                the end of the year;
                    (B) a fast-track process or failsafe mechanism to 
                give Congress the ability to expedite consideration of 
                legislation to reduce spending and avoid the automatic 
                across-the-board spending reductions; and
                    (C) an exemption of Social Security from these 
                enforcement mechanisms, with Social Security solvency 
                ensured as provide in section 502.
            (3) Limits on total spending with long-term structural 
        reforms that--
                    (A) require--
                            (i) the Office of Management and Budget and 
                        the Congressional Budget Office to make long-
                        term budget projections (similar to the 
                        timeframes of projections made by the Social 
                        Security and Medicare trustees);
                            (ii) the inclusion of the estimated long-
                        term fiscal impact of the President's budget in 
                        the President's annual budget submission;
                            (iii) in the Congressional Budget Office's 
                        reestimate of the President's budget, an 
                        estimate of the long-term impact of the 
                        President's budget; and
                            (iv) in Congressional Budget Office 
                        estimates on legislation, an estimate of the 
                        long-term impact of legislation that has a 
                        significant impact on the long-term budget;
                    (B) require enactment of enforceable caps on total 
                spending as a share of gross domestic product as set 
                forth in this resolution;
                    (C) require the review by Congress of Congressional 
                Budget Office projections relative to the statutory 
                caps and enactment of legislation to reduce spending to 
                meet those caps;
                    (D) require enactment of an enforcement mechanism 
                to ensure that if these spending reductions are not 
                achieved, there would be an across-the-board reduction 
                in spending at the end of the year;
                    (E) require enactment of a fast-track process or 
                failsafe mechanism to provide Congress with the ability 
                to expedite consideration of legislation to reduce 
                spending and avoid the automatic across-the-board 
                spending reductions; and
                    (F) exempt Social Security from these enforcement 
                mechanisms, with Social Security solvency ensured as 
                provided in section 501.

                TITLE VI--SENSE OF THE HOUSE PROVISIONS

SEC. 601. SENSE OF THE HOUSE ON A RESPONSIBLE DEFICIT REDUCTION PLAN 
              MUST CONSIDER ALL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THOSE AT THE 
              PENTAGON AND THE OTHER NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCIES.

    It is the sense of the House that the Nation's debt is an immense 
security threat to our country, just as Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, has stated; the Government Accountability Office 
has recently issued a report documenting billions of dollars of waste 
and duplication at Government agencies, including the Department of 
Defense, and the Department of Defense has never passed a clean audit; 
the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform 
and the bipartisan Rivlin-Domenici Debt Reduction Task Force were 
correct in concluding that all programs, including national security, 
should be ``on the table'' as part of a deficit reduction plan; and any 
budget plan serious about reducing the deficit must follow this precept 
to consider all programs, including national security programs, the 
largest segment of discretionary spending.

SEC. 602. SENSE OF THE HOUSE REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF CHILD SUPPORT 
              ENFORCEMENT.

    It is the sense of the House that--
            (1) additional legislative action is needed to ensure that 
        States have the necessary resources to collect all child 
        support that is owed to families and allow them to pass 100 
        percent of support on to families without financial penalty; 
        and
            (2) when 100 percent of child support payments are passed 
        to the child, rather than administrative expenses, program 
        integrity is improved and child support participation 
        increases.

            Passed the House of Representatives April 15, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                 KAREN L. HAAS,

                                                                 Clerk.

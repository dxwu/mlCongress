    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK--QUILEUTE TRIBE.
    (a) Definitions.--In this section:
        (1) Map.--The term ``Map'' means the map entitled ``Olympic 
    National Park and Quileute Reservation Boundary Adjustment Map'', 
    numbered 149/80,059, and dated June 2010.
        (2) Park.--The term ``Park'' means the Olympic National Park, 
    located in the State of Washington.
        (3) Reservation.--The term ``Reservation'' means the Quileute 
    Indian Reservation, located on the Olympic Peninsula in the State 
    of Washington.
        (4) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary of 
    the Interior.
        (5) Tribe.--The term ``Tribe'' means the Quileute Indian Tribe 
    in the State of Washington.
    (b) Findings and Purpose.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (A) the Reservation is located on the western coast of the 
        Olympic Peninsula in the State of Washington, bordered by the 
        Pacific Ocean to the west and the Park on the north, south, and 
        east;
            (B) most of the Reservation village of La Push is located 
        within the coastal flood plain, with the Tribe's administrative 
        buildings, school, elder center, and housing all located in a 
        tsunami zone;
            (C) for many decades, the Tribe and the Park have had a 
        dispute over the Reservation boundaries along the Quillayute 
        River;
            (D) in recent years, this dispute has intensified as the 
        Tribe has faced an urgent need for additional lands for 
        housing, schools, and other Tribe purposes outside the tsunami 
        and Quillayute River flood zones; and
            (E) the lack of a settlement of this dispute threatens to 
        adversely impact the public's existing and future recreational 
        use of several attractions in the Park that are accessed by the 
        public's use of Reservation lands.
        (2) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
            (A) to resolve the longstanding dispute along portions of 
        the northern boundary of the Quileute Indian Reservation;
            (B) to clarify public use and access to Olympic National 
        Park lands that are contiguous to the Reservation;
            (C) to provide the Quileute Indian Tribe with approximately 
        275 acres of land currently located within the Park and 
        approximately 510 acres of land along the Quillayute River, 
        also within the Park;
            (D) to adjust the wilderness boundaries to provide the 
        Quileute Indian Tribe Tsunami and flood protection; and
            (E) through the land conveyance, to grant the Tribe access 
        to land outside of tsunami and Quillayute River flood zones, 
        and link existing Reservation land with Tribe land to the east 
        of the Park.
    (c) Redesignation of Federal Wilderness Land, Olympic National Park 
Conveyance.--
        (1) Redesignation of wilderness.--Certain Federal land in the

        this section, conduct a survey, defining the boundaries of the 
        Reservation and Park, and of the Federal lands taken into and

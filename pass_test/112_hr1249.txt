invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a 
whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the 
claimed invention to a person having ordinary skill in the art to which 
the claimed invention pertains. Patentability shall not be negated by 
the manner in which the invention was made.''.

a petition to institute a derivation proceeding in the Office. The 
petition shall set forth with particularity the basis for finding that 
an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed 
invention from an inventor named in the petitioner's application and, 
without authorization, the earlier application claiming such invention 
was filed. Any such petition may be filed only within the 1-year period 
beginning on the date of the first publication of a claim to an 
invention that is the same or substantially the same as the earlier 
application's claim to the invention, shall be made under oath, and 
shall be supported by substantial evidence. Whenever the Director 
determines that a petition filed under this subsection demonstrates 
that the standards for instituting a derivation proceeding are met, the 
Director may institute a derivation proceeding. The determination by 
the Director whether to institute a derivation proceeding shall be 
final and nonappealable.
    ``(b) Determination by Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--In a 
derivation proceeding instituted under subsection (a), the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board shall determine whether an inventor named in the 
earlier application derived the claimed invention from an inventor 
named in the petitioner's application and, without authorization, the 
earlier application claiming such invention was filed. In appropriate 
circumstances, the Patent Trial and Appeal Board may correct the naming 
of the inventor in any application or patent at issue. The Director 
shall prescribe regulations setting forth standards for the conduct of 
derivation proceedings, including requiring parties to provide 
sufficient evidence to prove and rebut a claim of derivation.
    ``(c) Deferral of Decision.--The Patent Trial and Appeal Board may 
defer action on a petition for a derivation proceeding until the 
expiration of the 3-month period beginning on the date on which the 
Director issues a patent that includes the claimed invention that is 
the subject of the petition. The Patent Trial and Appeal Board also may 
defer action on a petition for a derivation proceeding, or stay the 
proceeding after it has been instituted, until the termination of a 
proceeding under chapter 30, 31, or 32 involving the patent of the 
earlier applicant.
    ``(d) Effect of Final Decision.--The final decision of the Patent 
Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in an application for 
patent, shall constitute the final refusal by the Office on those 
claims. The final decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, if 
adverse to claims in a patent, shall, if no appeal or other review of 
the decision has been or can be taken or had, constitute cancellation 
of those claims, and notice of such cancellation shall be endorsed on 
copies of the patent distributed after such cancellation.
    ``(e) Settlement.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under 
subsection (a) may terminate the proceeding by filing a written 
statement reflecting the agreement of the parties as to the correct 
inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. Unless the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board finds the agreement to be inconsistent with the 
evidence of record, if any, it shall take action consistent with the 
agreement. Any written settlement or understanding of the parties shall 
be filed with the Director. At the request of a party to the 
proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be treated as business 
confidential information, shall be kept separate from the file of the 
involved patents or applications, and shall be made available only to 
Government agencies on written request, or to any person on a showing 
of good cause.
    ``(f) Arbitration.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under 
subsection (a) may, within such time as may be specified by the 
Director by regulation, determine such contest or any aspect thereof by 
arbitration. Such arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of 
title 9, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this 
section. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to the 
Director, and such award shall, as between the parties to the 
arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The 
arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given. 
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from determining 
the patentability of the claimed inventions involved in the 
proceeding.''.

    sentence of that section.
        (3) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) shall

            business concerns to obtain patents and their costs of 
            obtaining patents;
                (ii) whether the change would create, mitigate, or

            that are small business concerns relative to applicants for 
            patents that are not small business concerns, and whether 
            the change would create any advantages for applicants for

    beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director 
    shall report, to the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate and 
    the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, the 
    findings and recommendations of the Director on the operation of 
    prior user rights in selected countries in the industrialized 
    world. The report shall include the following:
            (A) A comparison between patent laws of the United States 
        and the laws of other industrialized countries, including 
        members of the European Union and Japan, Canada, and Australia.
            (B) An analysis of the effect of prior user rights on 
        innovation rates in the selected countries.
            (C) An analysis of the correlation, if any, between prior 
        user rights and start-up enterprises and the ability to attract 
        venture capital to start new companies.
            (D) An analysis of the effect of prior user rights, if any, 
        on small businesses, universities, and individual inventors.
            (E) An analysis of legal and constitutional issues, if any, 
        that arise from placing trade secret law in patent law.
            (F) An analysis of whether the change to a first-to-file 
        patent system creates a particular need for prior user rights.
        (2) Consultation with other agencies.--In preparing the report 
    required under paragraph (1), the Director shall consult with the 
    United States Trade Representative, the Secretary of State, and the 
    Attorney General.
    (n) Effective Date.--
        (1) In general.--Except as otherwise provided in this section, 
    the amendments made by this section shall take effect upon the 
    expiration of the 18-month period beginning on the date of the 
    enactment of this Act, and shall apply to any application for 
    patent, and to any patent issuing thereon, that contains or 
    contained at any time--
            (A) a claim to a claimed invention that has an effective 
        filing date as defined in section 100(i) of title 35, United 
        States Code, that is on or after the effective date described 
        in this paragraph; or
            (B) a specific reference under section 120, 121, or 365(c) 
        of title 35, United States Code, to any patent or application 
        that contains or contained at any time such a claim.
        (2) Interfering patents.--The provisions of sections 102(g), 
    135, and 291 of title 35, United States Code, as in effect on the 
    day before the effective date set forth in paragraph (1) of this 
    subsection, shall apply to each claim of an application for patent, 
    and any patent issued thereon, for which the amendments made by 
    this section also apply, if such application or patent contains or 
    contained at any time--
            (A) a claim to an invention having an effective filing date 
        as defined in section 100(i) of title 35, United States Code, 
        that occurs before the effective date set forth in paragraph 
        (1) of this subsection; or
            (B) a specific reference under section 120, 121, or 365(c) 
        of title 35, United States Code, to any patent or application 
        that contains or contained at any time such a claim.
    (o) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
converting the United States patent system from ``first to invent'' to 
a system of ``first inventor to file'' will promote the progress of 
science and the useful arts by securing for limited times to inventors 
the exclusive rights to their discoveries and provide inventors with 
greater certainty regarding the scope of protection provided by the 
grant of exclusive rights to their discoveries.
    (p) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress that 
converting the United States patent system from ``first to invent'' to 
a system of ``first inventor to file'' will improve the United States 
patent system and promote harmonization of the United States patent 
system with the patent systems commonly used in nearly all other 
countries throughout the world with whom the United States conducts 
trade and thereby promote greater international uniformity and 
certainty in the procedures used for securing the exclusive rights of 
inventors to their discoveries.

        when acquired by a person as part of an assignment or transfer 
        described in subparagraph (B), may only be asserted for uses at 
        sites where the subject matter that would otherwise infringe a

    qualifies under this section occurred, except that the defense 
    shall also extend to variations in the quantity or volume of use of 
    the claimed subject matter, and to improvements in the claimed 
    subject matter that do not infringe additional specifically claimed

        matter of the claimed invention could not have been undertaken 
        using funds provided by the Federal Government.
    ``(f) Unreasonable Assertion of Defense.--If the defense under this 
section is pleaded by a person who is found to infringe the patent and 
who subsequently fails to demonstrate a reasonable basis for asserting 
the defense, the court shall find the case exceptional for the purpose 
of awarding attorney fees under section 285.

table of sections for chapter 28 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended to read as follows:

reasonable, considering the aggregate costs of the post-grant review.
    ``(b) Scope.--A petitioner in a post-grant review may request to 
cancel as unpatentable 1 or more claims of a patent on any ground that 
could be raised under paragraph (2) or (3) of section 282(b) (relating 
to invalidity of the patent or any claim).
    ``(c) Filing Deadline.--A petition for a post-grant review may only 
be filed not later than the date that is 9 months after the date of the 
grant of the patent or of the issuance of a reissue patent (as the case 
may be).
``Sec. 322. Petitions
    ``(a) Requirements of Petition.--A petition filed under section 321 
may be considered only if--
        ``(1) the petition is accompanied by payment of the fee 
    established by the Director under section 321;
        ``(2) the petition identifies all real parties in interest;
        ``(3) the petition identifies, in writing and with 
    particularity, each claim challenged, the grounds on which the 
    challenge to each claim is based, and the evidence that supports 
    the grounds for the challenge to each claim, including--

        petitioner relies upon in support of the petition; and

    Director may require by regulation; and

receipt of a petition under section 321, the Director shall make the 
petition available to the public.
``Sec. 323. Preliminary response to petition

patent owner shall have the right to file a preliminary response to the 
petition, within a time period set by the Director, that sets forth 
reasons why no post-grant review should be instituted based upon the 
failure of the petition to meet any requirement of this chapter.
``Sec. 324. Institution of post-grant review
    ``(a) Threshold.--The Director may not authorize a post-grant 
review to be instituted unless the Director determines that the 
information presented in the petition filed under section 321, if such 
information is not rebutted, would demonstrate that it is more likely 
than not that at least 1 of the claims challenged in the petition is 
unpatentable.
    ``(b) Additional Grounds.--The determination required under 
subsection (a) may also be satisfied by a showing that the petition 
raises a novel or unsettled legal question that is important to other 
patents or patent applications.
    ``(c) Timing.--The Director shall determine whether to institute a 
post-grant review under this chapter pursuant to a petition filed under 
section 321 within 3 months after--
        ``(1) receiving a preliminary response to the petition under 
    section 323; or
        ``(2) if no such preliminary response is filed, the last date 
    on which such response may be filed.

owner, in writing, of the Director's determination under subsection (a) 
or (b), and shall make such notice available to the public as soon as 
is practicable. Such notice shall include the date on which the review 
shall commence.

institute a post-grant review under this section shall be final and 
nonappealable.

    ``(a) Infringer's Civil Action.--
        ``(1) Post-grant review barred by civil action.--A post-grant 
    review may not be instituted under this chapter if, before the date 
    on which the petition for such a review is filed, the petitioner or 
    real party in interest filed a civil action challenging the 
    validity of a claim of the patent.
        ``(2) Stay of civil action.--If the petitioner or real party in 
    interest files a civil action challenging the validity of a claim 
    of the patent on or after the date on which the petitioner files a 
    petition for post-grant review of the patent, that civil action 
    shall be automatically stayed until either--
            ``(A) the patent owner moves the court to lift the stay;
            ``(B) the patent owner files a civil action or counterclaim 
        alleging that the petitioner or real party in interest has 
        infringed the patent; or
            ``(C) the petitioner or real party in interest moves the 
        court to dismiss the civil action.
        ``(3) Treatment of counterclaim.--A counterclaim challenging 
    the validity of a claim of a patent does not constitute a civil 
    action challenging the validity of a claim of a patent for purposes 
    of this subsection.
    ``(b) Preliminary Injunctions.--If a civil action alleging 
infringement of a patent is filed within 3 months after the date on 
which the patent is granted, the court may not stay its consideration 
of the patent owner's motion for a preliminary injunction against 
infringement of the patent on the basis that a petition for post-grant 
review has been filed under this chapter or that such a post-grant 
review has been instituted under this chapter.
    ``(c) Joinder.--If more than 1 petition for a post-grant review 
under this chapter is properly filed against the same patent and the 
Director determines that more than 1 of these petitions warrants the 
institution of a post-grant review under section 324, the Director may 
consolidate such reviews into a single post-grant review.
    ``(d) Multiple Proceedings.--Notwithstanding sections 135(a), 251, 
and 252, and chapter 30, during the pendency of any post-grant review 
under this chapter, if another proceeding or matter involving the 
patent is before the Office, the Director may determine the manner in 
which the post-grant review or other proceeding or matter may proceed, 
including providing for the stay, transfer, consolidation, or 
termination of any such matter or proceeding. In determining whether to 
institute or order a proceeding under this chapter, chapter 30, or 
chapter 31, the Director may take into account whether, and reject the 
petition or request because, the same or substantially the same prior 
art or arguments previously were presented to the Office.

        ``(1) Proceedings before the office.--The petitioner in a post-
    grant review of a claim in a patent under this chapter that results 
    in a final written decision under section 328(a), or the real party 
    in interest or privy of the petitioner, may not request or maintain 
    a proceeding before the Office with respect to that claim on any 
    ground that the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised 
    during that post-grant review.

    post-grant review of a claim in a patent under this chapter that 
    results in a final written decision under section 328(a), or the 
    real party in interest or privy of the petitioner, may not assert 
    either in a civil action arising in whole or in part under section 
    1338 of title 28 or in a proceeding before the International Trade 
    Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 that the 
    claim is invalid on any ground that the petitioner raised or 
    reasonably could have raised during that post-grant review.
    ``(f) Reissue Patents.--A post-grant review may not be instituted 
under this chapter if the petition requests cancellation of a claim in 
a reissue patent that is identical to or narrower than a claim in the 
original patent from which the reissue patent was issued, and the time 
limitations in section 321(c) would bar filing a petition for a post-
grant review for such original patent.

section, a micro entity shall include an applicant who certifies that--

necessary and appropriate. At least 3 months before any limits proposed 
to be imposed pursuant to this subsection take effect, the Director 
shall inform the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate of any 
such proposed limits.''.

    (a) In General.--Chapter 25 of title 35, United States Code, is 
amended by adding at the end the following:
``Sec. 257. Supplemental examinations to consider, reconsider, or 
   correct information
    ``(a) Request for Supplemental Examination.--A patent owner may 
request supplemental examination of a patent in the Office to consider, 
reconsider, or correct information believed to be relevant to the 
patent, in accordance with such requirements as the Director may 
establish. Within 3 months after the date a request for supplemental 
examination meeting the requirements of this section is received, the 
Director shall conduct the supplemental examination and shall conclude 
such examination by issuing a certificate indicating whether the 
information presented in the request raises a substantial new question 
of patentability.
    ``(b) Reexamination Ordered.--If the certificate issued under 
subsection (a) indicates that a substantial new question of 
patentability is raised by 1 or more items of information in the 
request, the Director shall order reexamination of the patent. The 
reexamination shall be conducted according to procedures established by 
chapter 30, except that the patent owner shall not have the right to 
file a statement pursuant to section 304. During the reexamination, the 
Director shall address each substantial new question of patentability 
identified during the supplemental examination, notwithstanding the 
limitations in chapter 30 relating to patents and printed publication 
or any other provision of such chapter.
    ``(c) Effect.--
        ``(1) In general.--A patent shall not be held unenforceable on 
    the basis of conduct relating to information that had not been 
    considered, was inadequately considered, or was incorrect in a 
    prior examination of the patent if the information was considered, 
    reconsidered, or corrected during a supplemental examination of the 
    patent. The making of a request under subsection (a), or the 
    absence thereof, shall not be relevant to enforceability of the 
    patent under section 282.
        ``(2) Exceptions.--
            ``(A) Prior allegations.--Paragraph (1) shall not apply to 
        an allegation pled with particularity in a civil action, or set 
        forth with particularity in a notice received by the patent 
        owner under section 505(j)(2)(B)(iv)(II) of the Federal Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 355(j)(2)(B)(iv)(II)), before 
        the date of a supplemental examination request under subsection 
        (a) to consider, reconsider, or correct information forming the 
        basis for the allegation.
            ``(B) Patent enforcement actions.--In an action brought 
        under section 337(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
        1337(a)), or section 281 of this title, paragraph (1) shall not 
        apply to any defense raised in the action that is based upon 
        information that was considered, reconsidered, or corrected 
        pursuant to a supplemental examination request under subsection 
        (a), unless the supplemental examination, and any reexamination 
        ordered pursuant to the request, are concluded before the date 
        on which the action is brought.
    ``(d) Fees and Regulations.--
        ``(1) Fees.--The Director shall, by regulation, establish fees 
    for the submission of a request for supplemental examination of a 
    patent, and to consider each item of information submitted in the 
    request. If reexamination is ordered under subsection (b), fees 
    established and applicable to ex parte reexamination proceedings 
    under chapter 30 shall be paid, in addition to fees applicable to 
    supplemental examination.
        ``(2) Regulations.--The Director shall issue regulations 
    governing the form, content, and other requirements of requests for 
    supplemental examination, and establishing procedures for reviewing 
    information submitted in such requests.
    ``(e) Fraud.--If the Director becomes aware, during the course of a 
supplemental examination or reexamination proceeding ordered under this 
section, that a material fraud on the Office may have been committed in 
connection with the patent that is the subject of the supplemental 
examination, then in addition to any other actions the Director is 
authorized to take, including the cancellation of any claims found to 
be invalid under section 307 as a result of a reexamination ordered 
under this section, the Director shall also refer the matter to the 
Attorney General for such further action as the Attorney General may 
deem appropriate. Any such referral shall be treated as confidential, 
shall not be included in the file of the patent, and shall not be 
disclosed to the public unless the United States charges a person with 
a criminal offense in connection with such referral.
    ``(f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed--
        ``(1) to preclude the imposition of sanctions based upon 
    criminal or antitrust laws (including section 1001(a) of title 18, 
    the first section of the Clayton Act, and section 5 of the Federal 
    Trade Commission Act to the extent that section relates to unfair 
    methods of competition);
        ``(2) to limit the authority of the Director to investigate 
    issues of possible misconduct and impose sanctions for misconduct 
    in connection with matters or proceedings before the Office; or
        ``(3) to limit the authority of the Director to issue 
    regulations under chapter 3 relating to sanctions for misconduct by 
    representatives practicing before the Office.''.

section 102 or 103 of title 35, United States Code, any strategy for 
reducing, avoiding, or deferring tax liability, whether known or 
unknown at the time of the invention or application for patent, shall 
be deemed insufficient to differentiate a claimed invention from the 
prior art.
    (b) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term ``tax 
liability'' refers to any liability for a tax under any Federal, State, 
or local law, or the law of any foreign jurisdiction, including any 
statute, rule, regulation, or ordinance that levies, imposes, or 
assesses such tax liability.
    (c) Exclusions.--This section does not apply to that part of an 
invention that--
        (1) is a method, apparatus, technology, computer program 
    product, or system, that is used solely for preparing a tax or 
    information return or other tax filing, including one that records, 
    transmits, transfers, or organizes data related to such filing; or
        (2) is a method, apparatus, technology, computer program 
    product, or system used solely for financial management, to the 
    extent that it is severable from any tax strategy or does not limit 
    the use of any tax strategy by any taxpayer or tax advisor.
    (d) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be 
construed to imply that other business methods are patentable or that 
other business method patents are valid.
    (e) Effective Date; Applicability.--This section shall take effect 
on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply to any patent 
application that is pending on, or filed on or after, that date, and to

    to comply with--

        failure to disclose the best mode shall not be a basis on which 
        any claim of a patent may be canceled or held invalid or 
        otherwise unenforceable; or
            ``(B) any requirement of section 251.''.

        of this subsection, as an alternative to the physical marking 
        of articles;
            (B) an analysis of whether such virtual marking has limited 
        or improved the ability of the general public to access 
        information about patents;

            (B) A person may not file a petition for a transitional 
        proceeding with respect to a covered business method patent 
        unless the person or the person's real party in interest or 
        privy has been sued for infringement of the patent or has been 
        charged with infringement under that patent.
            (C) A petitioner in a transitional proceeding who 
        challenges the validity of 1 or more claims in a covered 
        business method patent on a ground raised under section 102 or 
        103 of title 35, United States Code, as in effect on the day 
        before the effective date set forth in section 3(n)(1), may 
        support such ground only on the basis of--

                    (I) discloses the invention more than 1 year before 
                the date of the application for patent in the United 
                States; and
                    (II) would be described by section 102(a) of such 
                title (as in effect on the day before the effective 
                date set forth in section 3(n)(1)) if the disclosure 
                had been made by another before the invention thereof 
                by the applicant for patent.

            (D) The petitioner in a transitional proceeding that 
        results in a final written decision under section 328(a) of 
        title 35, United States Code, with respect to a claim in a 
        covered business method patent, or the petitioner's real party 
        in interest, may not assert, either in a civil action arising 
        in whole or in part under section 1338 of title 28, United 
        States Code, or in a proceeding before the International Trade 
        Commission under section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 
        U.S.C. 1337), that the claim is invalid on any ground that the

    shall take effect upon the expiration of the 1-year period 
    beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act and shall apply

    that effective date, except that the regulations shall not apply to 
    a patent described in section 6(f)(2)(A) of this Act during the 
    period in which a petition for post-grant review of that patent 
    would satisfy the requirements of section 321(c) of title 35, 
    United States Code.
        (3) Sunset.--

    alleging infringement of a patent under section 281 of title 35, 
    United States Code, relating to a transitional proceeding for that 
    patent, the court shall decide whether to enter a stay based on--
            (A) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will simplify 
        the issues in question and streamline the trial;
            (B) whether discovery is complete and whether a trial date 
        has been set;
            (C) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, would unduly 
        prejudice the nonmoving party or present a clear tactical 
        advantage for the moving party; and
            (D) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will reduce the 
        burden of litigation on the parties and on the court.
        (2) Review.--A party may take an immediate interlocutory appeal 
    from a district court's decision under paragraph (1). The United

    established precedent, and such review may be de novo.
    (c) ATM Exemption for Venue Purposes.--In an action for 
infringement under section 281 of title 35, United States Code, of a 
covered business method patent, an automated teller machine shall not 
be deemed to be a regular and established place of business for 
purposes of section 1400(b) of title 28, United States Code.

        (2) Regulations.--To assist in implementing the transitional 
    proceeding authorized by this subsection, the Director shall issue

court of the United States for the district and division embracing the 
place where the action is pending.
    ``(b) Special Rules.--The removal of an action under this section 
shall be made in accordance with section 1446, except that if the

    extended at any time for cause shown.
    ``(c) Clarification of Jurisdiction in Certain Cases.--The court to

section, the district court--
        ``(1) shall remand all claims that are neither a basis for

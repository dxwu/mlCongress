To designate the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the Birthplace of the 
                  National Guard of the United States.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. OFFICIAL DESIGNATION OF SALEM, MASSACHUSETTS, AS THE 
BIRTHPLACE OF THE NATIONAL GUARD OF THE UNITED STATES.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) In 1629, Captain John Endicott organized the first militia 
    in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in Salem.
        (2) The colonists had adopted the English militia system, which 
    required all males between the ages of 16 and 60 to possess arms 
    and participate in the defense of the community.
        (3) In 1636, the Massachusetts General Court ordered the 
    organization of three militia regiments, designated as the North, 
    South, and East regiments.
        (4) These regiments drilled once a week and provided guard 
    details each evening to sound the alarm in case of attack.
        (5) The East Regiment, the predecessor of the 101st Engineer 
    Battalion, assembled as a regiment for the first time in 1637 on 
    the Salem Common, marking the beginning of the Massachusetts 
    National Guard and the National Guard of the United States.
        (6) Since 1785, Salem's own Second Corps of Cadets (101st and 
    102nd Field Artillery) has celebrated the anniversary of that first 
    muster.
        (7) As the policy contained in section 102 of title 32, United 
    States Code, clearly expresses, the National Guard continues its 
    historic mission of providing units for the first line defense of 
    the United States and current missions throughout the world.
        (8) The designation of the City of Salem, Massachusetts, as the 
    Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States will 
    contribute positively to tourism and economic development in the 
    city, create jobs, and instill pride in both the local and State 
    communities.
    (b) Designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as National Guard 
Birthplace.--In light of the findings made in subsection (a), the City 
of Salem, Massachusetts, is hereby designated as the Birthplace of the 
National Guard of the United States.
    (c) Responsibilities.--
        (1) Military ceremonial support.--The Chief of the National 
    Guard Bureau, in conjunction with the Secretary of the Army, the 
    Secretary of the Air Force, the Council of Governors, and the 
    Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts, shall provide 
    military ceremonial support at the dedication of any monument, 
    plaque, or other form of official recognition placed in Salem, 
    Massachusetts, celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, 
    as the Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States.
        (2) Funding source.--Federal funds may not be used to design, 
    procure, prepare, install, or maintain any monument, plaque, or 
    other form of official recognition placed in Salem, Massachusetts, 
    celebrating the designation of Salem, Massachusetts, as the 
    Birthplace of the National Guard of the United States, but the 
    Adjutant General of the State of Massachusetts may accept and 
    expend contributions of non-Federal funds for this purpose.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.

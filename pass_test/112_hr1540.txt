    Selected Reserve of the Ready Reserve that otherwise use military

        (2) identify various means for the management by the Department 
    of the transition of military technicians to a system that relies 
    on traditional personnel categories of active duty personnel, 
    reserve component personnel, and civilian personnel, and for the 
    management of any effects of that transition on the pay and 
    benefits of current military technicians (including means for 
    mitigating or avoiding such effects in the course of such 
    transition);

    status, until separation or retirement, rather than transitioned to 
    such a traditional personnel category;
        (4) identify and take into account the unique needs of the 
    National Guard in the management and use of military technicians;
        (5) determine potential cost savings, if any, to be achieved as

    savings in long-term mandatory entitlement costs associated with 
    military and civil service retirement obligations;
        (6) develop a recommendation on the feasibility and 
    advisability of terminating the military technician as a distinct 
    personnel management category, and, if the termination is 
    determined to be feasible and advisable, develop recommendations 
    for appropriate legislative and administrative action to implement 
    the termination;
        (7) address any other matter relating to the management and 
    long-term viability of the military technician as a distinct 
    personnel management category that the Secretary shall specify for 
    purposes of the study; and

    (dual status).
    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the study required by subsection (a). 
The report shall set forth the results of the study, including the 
matters specified in subsection (b), and include such comments and 
recommendations on the results of the study as the Secretary considers 
appropriate.

                Subtitle C--General Service Authorities

    SEC. 521. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE UNIQUE NATURE, DEMANDS, AND 
      HARDSHIPS OF MILITARY SERVICE.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) section 8 (clauses 12, 13, and 14) of Article I of the 
    Constitution of the United States commits exclusively to Congress 
    the powers to raise and support armies, provide and maintain a 
    Navy, and make rules for the government and regulation of the land 
    and naval forces;
        (2) there is no constitutional right to serve in the Armed 
    Forces;
        (3) pursuant to the powers conferred by section 8 of article I 
    of the Constitution of the United States, it lies within the 
    discretion of the Congress to establish qualifications for and 
    conditions of service in the Armed Forces;
        (4) the primary purpose of the Armed Forces is to prepare for 
    and to prevail in combat should the need arise;
        (5) the conduct of military operations requires members of the 
    Armed Forces to make extraordinary sacrifices, including the 
    ultimate sacrifice, in order to provide for the common defense;
        (6) success in combat requires military units that are 
    characterized by high morale, good order and discipline, and unit 
    cohesion;
        (7) one of the most critical elements in combat capability is 
    unit cohesion, that is, the bonds of trust among individual members 
    of the Armed Forces that make the combat effectiveness of a 
    military unit greater than the sum of the combat effectiveness of 
    individual unit members;
        (8) military life is fundamentally different from civilian life 
    in that--
            (A) the extraordinary responsibilities of the Armed Forces, 
        the unique conditions of military service, and the critical 
        role of unit cohesion require that the military community, 
        while subject to civilian control, exist as a specialized 
        society; and
            (B) the military society is characterized by its own laws, 
        rules, customs, and traditions, including numerous restrictions 
        on personal behavior, that would not be acceptable in civilian 
        society;
        (9) the standards of conduct for members of the Armed Forces 
    regulate a member's life for 24 hours each day beginning at the 
    moment the member enters military status and not ending until that 
    person is discharged or otherwise separated from the Armed Forces;
        (10) those standards of conduct, including the Uniform Code of 
    Military Justice, apply to a member of the Armed Forces at all 
    times that the member has a military status, whether the member is 
    on base or off base, and whether the member is on duty or off duty;
        (11) the pervasive application of the standards of conduct is 
    necessary because members of the Armed Forces must be ready at all 
    times for worldwide deployment to a combat environment;
        (12) the worldwide deployment of United States military forces, 
    the international responsibilities of the United States, and the 
    potential for involvement of the Armed Forces in actual combat 
    routinely make it necessary for members of the Armed Forces 
    involuntarily to accept living conditions and working conditions 
    that are often spartan, primitive, and characterized by forced 
    intimacy with little or no privacy; and
        (13) the Armed Forces must maintain personnel policies that are 
    intended to recruit and retain only those persons whose presence in 
    the Armed Forces serves the needs of the Armed Forces, contributes 
    to the accomplishment of the missions of the Armed Forces, and 
    maintains the high standards of the Armed Forces for morale, good 
    order and discipline, and unit cohesion that are the essence of 
    military capability.
    SEC. 522. POLICY ADDRESSING DWELL TIME AND MEASUREMENT AND DATA 
      COLLECTION REGARDING UNIT OPERATING TEMPO AND PERSONNEL TEMPO.
    (a) Policy Addressing Dwell Time.--Subsection (a) of section 991 of 
title 10, United States Code, is amended by adding at the end the 
following new paragraph:
    ``(4) The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe a policy that 
addresses the amount of dwell time a member of the armed forces or unit 
remains at the member's or unit's permanent duty station or home port, 
as the case may be, between deployments.''.

        enduring stockpile stewardship program and maintain and 
        modernize nuclear weapons production capabilities and 
        capacities to ensure the safety, security, reliability, and 
        credibility of the United States nuclear deterrent and to meet 
        requirements for hedging against possible international 
        developments or technical problems;
            (C) the United States should maintain nuclear weapons 
        laboratories and plants and preserve the intellectual 
        infrastructure, including competencies and skill sets; and
            (D) the United States should provide the necessary 
        resources to achieve these goals, using as a starting point the 
        levels set forth in the President's 10-year plan provided to 
        Congress pursuant to section 1251 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123

        objectives of the United States with respect to nuclear 
        deterrence, extended deterrence, assurance of allies, and 
        defense;

    nuclear forces of the United States to support the goals of the 
    United States with respect to nuclear deterrence, extended

    United States; and

    transport and transit routes on which international trade, energy 
    security and prosperity depend. They require greater international 
    efforts to ensure their resilience against attack or disruption. 
    Some NATO countries will become more dependent on foreign energy 
    suppliers and in some cases, on foreign energy supply and 
    distribution networks for their energy needs. As a larger share of 
    world consumption is transported across the globe, energy supplies 
    are increasingly exposed to disruption.''.
        (2) The new NATO Strategic Concept further declares that, ``to 
    deter and defend against any threat to the safety and security of 
    our populations'', the NATO alliance will, ``develop the capacity 
    to contribute to energy security, including protection of critical 
    energy infrastructure and transit areas and lines, cooperation with

Congress that--
        (1) if the United States pursues arms control negotiations with 
    the Russian Federation, such negotiations should be aimed at the 
    reduction of Russian deployed and non-deployed non-strategic 
    nuclear weapons and increased transparency of such weapons; and
        (2) for purposes of such negotiations--
            (A) non-strategic nuclear weapons should be considered when 
        weighing the balance of the nuclear forces of the United States 
        and Russia; and
            (B) geographical relocation and consolidated or centralized 
        storage of non-strategic nuclear weapons by Russia should not 
        be considered a reduction or elimination of such weapons.
    (b) Regarding Extended Deterrence Commitment to Europe.--It is the 
sense of Congress that--
        (1) the commitment of the United States to extended deterrence 
    in Europe and the nuclear alliance of the North Atlantic Treaty 
    Organization (NATO) is an important component of ensuring and 
    linking the national security of the United States and its European 
    allies;
        (2) nuclear forces of the United States are a key component of 
    the NATO nuclear alliance; and
        (3) the presence of United States nuclear weapons in Europe--
    combined with NATO's unique nuclear sharing arrangements under 
    which non-nuclear members participate in nuclear planning and 
    possess specially configured aircraft capable of delivering nuclear 
    weapons--provides reassurance to NATO allies who feel exposed to 
    regional threats.

SEC. 1245. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 
OF IRAN.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury issued 
    a finding under section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, that 
    identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money laundering 
    concern.
        (2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network 
    of the Department of the Treasury wrote, ``The Central Bank of 
    Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted designated 
    Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to these banks in 
    2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several billion dollars to 
    designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, EDBI and Melli, 
    through a variety of payment schemes. In making these transfers, 
    the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by minimizing the direct 
    involvement of large international banks with both CBI and 
    designated Iranian banks.''.
        (3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the Treasury 
    for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, wrote, 
    ``Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking sector, 
    including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist financing, 
    proliferation financing, and money laundering risks for the global 
    financial system.''.
    (b) Designation of Financial Sector of Iran as of Primary Money 
Laundering Concern.--The financial sector of Iran, including the 
Central Bank of Iran, is designated as a primary money laundering 
concern for purposes of section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, 
because of the threat to government and financial institutions 
resulting from the illicit activities of the Government of Iran, 
including its pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international 
terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial institutions 
and evade sanctions.
    (c) Freezing of Assets of Iranian Financial Institutions.--The 
President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and prohibit all 
transactions in all property and interests in property of an Iranian 
financial institution if such property and interests in property are in 
the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within 
the possession or control of a United States person.

Iran and Other Iranian Financial Institutions.--

        strict conditions on the maintaining, in the United States of a 
        correspondent account or a payable-through account by a foreign 
        financial institution that the President determines has 
        knowingly conducted or facilitated any significant financial 
        transaction with the Central Bank of Iran or another Iranian 
        financial institution designated by the Secretary of the 
        Treasury for the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the 
        International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et 
        seq.); and
            (B) may impose sanctions pursuant to the International 
        Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) with 
        respect to the Central Bank of Iran.
        (2) Exception for sales of food, medicine, and medical 
    devices.--The President may not impose sanctions under paragraph 
    (1) with respect to any person for conducting or facilitating a 
    transaction for the sale of food, medicine, or medical devices to 
    Iran.
        (3) Applicability of sanctions with respect to foreign central 
    banks.--Except as provided in paragraph (4), sanctions imposed 
    under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a foreign 
    financial institution owned or controlled by the government of a 
    foreign country, including a central bank of a foreign country, 
    only insofar as it engages in a financial transaction for the sale 
    or purchase of petroleum or petroleum products to or from Iran

        the reports required by subparagraph (A), of whether the price 
        and supply of petroleum and petroleum products produced in 
        countries other than Iran is sufficient to permit purchasers of 
        petroleum and petroleum products from Iran to reduce 
        significantly in volume their purchases from Iran.
            (C) Application of sanctions.--Except as provided in 
        subparagraph (D), sanctions imposed under paragraph (1)(A) 
        shall apply with respect to a financial transaction conducted 
        or facilitated by a foreign financial institution on or after 
        the date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
        this Act for the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products 
        from Iran if the President determines pursuant to subparagraph 
        (B) that there is a sufficient supply of petroleum and 
        petroleum products from countries other than Iran to permit a 
        significant reduction in the volume of petroleum and petroleum 
        products purchased from Iran by or through foreign financial 
        institutions.
            (D) Exception.--Sanctions imposed pursuant to paragraph (1)

        report with respect to the country under this subparagraph.
        (5) Waiver.--The President may waive the imposition of 
    sanctions under paragraph (1) for a period of not more than 120 
    days, and may renew that waiver for additional periods of not more 
    than 120 days, if the President--
            (A) determines that such a waiver is in the national 
        security interest of the United States; and
            (B) submits to Congress a report--
                (i) providing a justification for the waiver; and
                (ii) that includes any concrete cooperation the 
            President has received or expects to receive as a result of

SEC. 3131. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE USE OF SAVINGS FROM EXCESS AMOUNTS 
FOR CERTAIN PENSION PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the employee pension plans maintained by the management and 
    operating contractors managing the national laboratories, plants, 
    and other facilities of the National Nuclear Security 
    Administration and the Office of Environmental Management of the 
    Department of Energy should be fully funded to ensure that pension 
    commitments made to the highly skilled scientists, engineers, and 
    other employees of the nuclear enterprise are kept; and
        (2) if economic conditions improve, or efficiencies are 
    identified, so that amounts appropriated for contributions to those 
    pension plans exceed the amounts required by law for those 
    contributions, the Administrator for Nuclear Security or the 
    Assistant Secretary of Energy for Environmental Management should 
    promptly obligate or expend the excess amounts on high priority 
    mission activities of the National Nuclear Security Administration 
    or the Office of Environmental Management, as the case may be.

                fund, or private equity firm owns a majority of the

            obligations between the portfolio company and the 
            applicant.

            (A) the veteran resides in an area that has a shortage of 
        low-income housing and because of such shortage the veteran 
        requires more assistance from a case manager than the Secretary

        receive case management services from the Secretary under such

        veterans, and to otherwise aid covered veterans in obtaining 
        such assistance and services;
            (C) to ensure the confidentiality of records maintained by 
        the entity on covered veterans receiving services through the 
        supported housing program described in subsection (a);
            (D) to establish such procedures for fiscal control and 
        fund accounting as the Secretary of Veterans Affairs considers 
        appropriate to ensure proper disbursement and accounting of 
        funds under a contract or agreement entered into by the entity 
        as described in subsection (a);
            (E) to submit to the Secretary each year, in such form and

            referred to the entity for such services and assistance;
                (iii) the specific goals jointly set by the entity and 
            the Secretary for the provision of such services and 
            assistance and whether the entity achieved such goals; and
                (iv) the average length of time taken by a covered 
            veteran who received such services and assistance to 
            successfully obtain suitable housing and the average 
            retention rate of such a veteran in such housing; and
            (F) to meet such other requirements as the Secretary 
        considers appropriate for purposes of providing assistance to 
        covered veterans in obtaining suitable housing; and
        (2) has demonstrated experience in--
            (A) identifying and serving homeless veterans, especially

clause:
                ``(vii) Use of website to determine final conditional 
            reimbursement amount.--

                    ``(I) Notice to secretary of expected date of a

                made by the Secretary pursuant to clause (i) for items 
                and services provided to the claimant, the claimant or

                any time beginning 120 days before the reasonably 
                expected date of a settlement, judgment, award, or 
                other payment, notify the Secretary that a payment is 
                reasonably expected and the expected date of such

                to authorized family or other representatives 
                recognized under regulations and to an applicable plan

                including those claims that relate to a potential

                access shall be provided to an individual, 
                representative, or plan through a website that requires 
                a password to gain access to the information. The

                payments on such website in as timely a manner as 
                possible but not later than 15 days after the date that 
                payment is made. Information related to claims and

                    apply.

                    receipt of secure electronic communications with 
                    the individual, representative, or plan involved.
                        ``(dd) The website provides that information is 
                    transmitted from the website in a form that 
                    includes an official time and date that the 
                    information is transmitted.
                        ``(ee) The website shall permit the individual,

                    ``(III) Use of timely web download as basis for 
                final conditional amount.--If an individual (or other 
                claimant or applicable plan with the consent of the 
                individual) obtains a statement of reimbursement amount 
                from the website during the protected period as defined 
                in subclause (V) and the related settlement, judgment, 
                award or other payment is made during such period, then 
                the last statement of reimbursement amount that is 
                downloaded during such period and within 3 business 
                days before the date of the settlement, judgment, 
                award, or other payment shall constitute the final 
                conditional amount subject to recovery under clause 
                (ii) related to such settlement, judgment, award, or 
                other payment.
                    ``(IV) Resolution of discrepancies.--If the 
                individual (or authorized representative) believes 
                there is a discrepancy with the statement of 
                reimbursement amount, the Secretary shall provide a 
                timely process to resolve the discrepancy. Under such 
                process the individual (or representative) must provide 
                documentation explaining the discrepancy and a proposal 
                to resolve such discrepancy. Within 11 business days 
                after the date of receipt of such documentation, the 
                Secretary shall determine whether there is a reasonable 
                basis to include or remove claims on the statement of 
                reimbursement. If the Secretary does not make such 
                determination within the 11 business-day period, then 
                the proposal to resolve the discrepancy shall be 
                accepted. If the Secretary determines within such 
                period that there is not a reasonable basis to include 
                or remove claims on the statement of reimbursement, the 
                proposal shall be rejected. If the Secretary determines 
                within such period that there is a reasonable basis to 
                conclude there is a discrepancy, the Secretary must 
                respond in a timely manner by agreeing to the proposal 
                to resolve the discrepancy or by providing 
                documentation showing with good cause why the Secretary 
                is not agreeing to such proposal and establishing an 
                alternate discrepancy resolution. In no case shall the 
                process under this subclause be treated as an appeals 
                process or as establishing a right of appeal for a 
                statement of reimbursement amount and there shall be no 
                administrative or judicial review of the Secretary's 
                determinations under this subclause.
                    ``(V) Protected period.--In subclause (III), the 
                term `protected period' means, with respect to a 
                settlement, judgment, award or other payment relating 
                to an injury or incident, the portion (if any) of the 
                period beginning on the date of notice under subclause 
                (I) with respect to such settlement, judgment, award, 
                or other payment that is after the end of a Secretarial 
                response period beginning on the date of such notice to 
                the Secretary. Such Secretarial response period shall 
                be a period of 65 days, except that such period may be 
                extended by the Secretary for a period of an additional 
                30 days if the Secretary determines that additional 
                time is required to address claims for which payment 
                has been made. Such Secretarial response period shall 
                be extended and shall not include any days for any part 
                of which the Secretary determines (in accordance with 
                regulations) that there was a failure in the claims and 
                payment posting system and the failure was justified 
                due to exceptional circumstances (as defined in such 
                regulations). Such regulations shall define exceptional 
                circumstances in a manner so that not more than 1 
                percent of the repayment obligations under this 
                subclause would qualify as exceptional circumstances.
                    ``(VI) Effective date.--The Secretary shall 
                promulgate final regulations to carry out this clause 
                not later than 9 months after the date of the enactment 
                of this clause.

                this clause, the term `website' includes any successor 
                technology.

            determinations relating to liability insurance (including 
            self-insurance), no fault insurance, and workers' 
            compensation laws and plans.--The Secretary shall 
            promulgate regulations establishing a right of appeal and 
            appeals process, with respect to any determination under 
            this subsection for a payment made under this title for an 
            item or service for which the Secretary is seeking to 
            recover conditional payments from an applicable plan (as 
            defined in paragraph (8)(F)) that is a primary plan under 
            subsection (A)(ii), under which the applicable plan 
            involved, or an attorney, agent, or third party 
            administrator on behalf of such plan, may appeal such 
            determination. The individual furnished such an item or 
            service shall be notified of the plan's intent to appeal 
            such determination''.

        an applicable plan arising from liability insurance (including 
        self-insurance) and from alleged physical trauma-based 
        incidents (excluding alleged ingestion, implantation, or 
        exposure cases) constituting a total payment obligation to a 
        claimant of not more than the single threshold amount

        ``Not later than 18 months after the date of enactment of this 
        sentence, the Secretary shall modify the reporting requirements 
        under this paragraph so that an applicable plan in complying 
        with such requirements is permitted but not required to access 
        or report to the Secretary beneficiary social security account 
        numbers or health identification claim numbers, except that the 
        deadline for such modification shall be extended by one or more 
        periods (specified by the Secretary) of up to 1 year each if 
        the Secretary notifies the committees of jurisdiction of the 
        House of Representatives and of the Senate that the prior 
        deadline for such modification, without such extension, 
        threatens patient privacy or the integrity of the secondary 
        payer program under this subsection. Any such deadline 
        extension notice shall include information on the progress 
        being made in implementing such modification and the 
        anticipated implementation date for such modification.''.

        reduce such supply chain risk; and
            (C) in a case where the head of the covered agency plans to 
        limit disclosure of information under subsection (b)(2), the

        information;
        (3) notifying the Director of National Intelligence that there 
    is a significant supply chain risk to the covered system concerned, 
    unless the head of the covered agency making the determination is

    SEC. 414. CREATING AN OFFICIAL RECORD OF THE OSAMA BIN LADEN 
      OPERATION.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) On May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed terrorist 
    leader Osama bin Laden during the course of a targeted strike 
    against his secret compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan.
        (2) Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist 
    organization, the most significant terrorism threat to the United 
    States and the international community.
        (3) Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks 
    which killed nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, 2001, the most 
    deadly terrorist attack against our Nation, in which al Qaeda 
    terrorists hijacked four airplanes and crashed them into the World 
    Trade Center in New York City, the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., 
    and, due to heroic efforts by civilian passengers to disrupt the 
    terrorists, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
        (4) Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other deadly 
    terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies, 
    including the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and 
    Tanzania and the 2000 attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and 
    against innocent civilians in countries around the world, including 
    the 2004 attack on commuter trains in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 
    bombings of the mass transit system in London, England.
        (5) Following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the 
    United States, under President George W. Bush, led an international 
    coalition into Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda, deny them a safe 
    haven in Afghanistan and ungoverned areas along the Pakistani 
    border, and bring Osama bin Laden to justice.
        (6) President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional forces 
    and resources to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan as ``the 
    central front in our enduring struggle against terrorism and 
    extremism''.
        (7) The valiant members of the United States Armed Forces have 
    courageously and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its affiliates in 
    Afghanistan and around the world.
        (8) The anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence community 
    have pursued al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and 
    around the world with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, and 
    professionalism.
        (9) The close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the 
    intelligence community prompted the Director of National 
    Intelligence, General James Clapper, to state, ``Never have I seen 
    a more remarkable example of focused integration, seamless 
    collaboration, and sheer professional magnificence as was 
    demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the ultimate demise 
    of Osama bin Laden.''.
        (10) While the death of Osama bin Laden represents a 
    significant blow to the al Qaeda organization and its affiliates 
    and to terrorist organizations around the world, terrorism remains 
    a critical threat to United States national security.
        (11) President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin Laden 
    has been al Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot 
    attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death 
    of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our 
    Nation's effort to defeat al Qaeda.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the raid that killed Osama bin Laden demonstrated the best 
    of the intelligence community's capabilities and teamwork;
        (2) for years to come, Americans will look back at this event 
    as a defining point in the history of the United States;
        (3) it is vitally important that the United States memorialize 
    all the events that led to the raid so that future generations will 
    have an official record of the events that transpired before, 
    during, and as a result of the operation; and
        (4) preserving this history now will allow the United States to 
    have an accurate account of the events while those that 
    participated in the events are still serving in the Government.
    (c) Report on the Operation That Killed Osama Bin Laden.--Not later 
than 90 days after the completion of the report being prepared by the 
Center for the Study of Intelligence that documents the history of and 
lessons learned from the raid that resulted in the death of Osama bin 
Laden, the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency shall submit 
such report to the congressional intelligence committees.
    (d) Preservation of Records.--The Director of the Central 
Intelligence Agency shall preserve any records, including intelligence 
information and assessments, used to generate the report described in 
subsection (c).
    SEC. 415. RECRUITMENT OF PERSONNEL IN THE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR 
      GENERAL.
    (a) Study.--The Inspector General of the Office of Personnel 
Management, in consultation with the Inspector General of the Central 
Intelligence Agency, shall carry out a study of the personnel 
authorities and available personnel benefits of the Office of the 
Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency. Such study shall 
include--
        (1) identification of any barriers or disincentives to the 
    recruitment or retention of experienced investigators within the 
    Office of the Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency; 
    and
        (2) a comparison of the personnel authorities of the Inspector 
    General of the Central Intelligence Agency with personnel 
    authorities of Inspectors General of other agencies and departments 
    of the United States, including a comparison of the benefits 
    available to experienced investigators within the Office of the 
    Inspector General of the Central Intelligence Agency with similar 
    benefits available within the offices of Inspectors General of such 
    other agencies or departments.
    (b) Recommendations.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Inspector General of the Office of Personnel 
Management shall submit to the congressional intelligence committees 
and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the 
Senate and the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the 
House of Representatives--
        (1) a report on the results of the study conducted under 
    subsection (a); and
        (2) any recommendations for legislative action based on such 
    results.
    (c) Funding.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this

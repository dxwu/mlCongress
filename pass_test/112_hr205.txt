SEC. 3. LAND TITLE REPORTS.
    (a) In General.--The Bureau of Indian Affairs shall prepare and 
submit to the Committee on Natural Resources of the House of 
Representatives and the Committee on Indian Affairs of the Senate a 
report regarding the history and experience of Indian tribes that have 
chosen to assume responsibility for operating the Indian Land Title and 
Records Office (referred to in this section as the ``LTRO'') functions 
from the Bureau of Indian Affairs.
    (b) Consultation.--In conducting the review under subsection (a), 
the Bureau of Indian Affairs shall consult with the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development Office of Native American Programs and 
the Indian tribes that are managing LTRO functions (referred to in this 
section as the ``managing Indian tribes'').
    (c) Contents.--The review under subsection (a) shall include an 
analysis of the following factors:
        (1) Whether and how tribal management of the LTRO functions has 
    expedited the processing and issuance of Indian land title 
    certifications as compared to the period during which the Bureau of 
    Indian Affairs managed the programs.
        (2) Whether and how tribal management of the LTRO functions has 
    increased home ownership among the population of the managing 
    Indian tribe.
        (3) What internal preparations and processes were required of 
    the managing Indian tribes prior to assuming management of the LTRO 
    functions.
        (4) Whether tribal management of the LTRO functions resulted in 
    a transfer of financial resources and manpower from the Bureau of 
    Indian Affairs to the managing Indian tribes and, if so, what 
    transfers were undertaken.
        (5) Whether, in appropriate circumstances and with the approval 
    of geographically proximate Indian tribes, the LTRO functions may 
    be performed by a single Indian tribe or a tribal consortium in a 
    cost effective manner.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

    Sec. 505.  None of the funds provided under this Act, or provided 
under previous appropriations Acts to the agencies funded by this Act 
that remain available for obligation or expenditure in fiscal year 
2012, or provided from any accounts in the Treasury of the United 
States derived by the collection of fees available to the agencies 
funded by this Act, shall be available for obligation or expenditure 
through a reprogramming of funds that: (1) creates or initiates a new

status of balances of appropriations at the account level. For 
unobligated, uncommitted balances and unobligated, committed balances 
the quarterly reports shall separately identify the amounts

extent to which such aspect is not fulfilled.
    Sec. 509.  Any costs incurred by a department or agency funded 
under this Act resulting from, or to prevent, personnel actions taken

between appropriations accounts as may be necessary to carry out this

this Act or any other provision of law may be used for--
        (1) the implementation of any tax or fee in connection with the 
    implementation of subsection 922(t) of title 18, United States 
    Code; and
        (2) any system to implement subsection 922(t) of title 18,

    destruction of any identifying information submitted by or on 
    behalf of any person who has been determined not to be prohibited 
    from possessing or receiving a firearm no more than 24 hours after 
    the system advises a Federal firearms licensee that possession or 
    receipt of a firearm by the prospective transferee would not 
    violate subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, United 
    States Code, or State law.
    Sec. 512.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, amounts 
deposited or available in the Fund established under 42 U.S.C. 10601 in

parents or legal guardians of such students.
    Sec. 514.  None of the funds made available in this Act may be

    Sec. 516. (a) Tracing studies conducted by the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives are released without adequate 
disclaimers regarding the limitations of the data.
    (b) The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives shall 
include in all such data releases, language similar to the following 
that would make clear that trace data cannot be used to draw broad 
conclusions about firearms-related crime:
        (1) Firearm traces are designed to assist law enforcement 
    authorities in conducting investigations by tracking the sale and 
    possession of specific firearms. Law enforcement agencies may 
    request firearms traces for any reason, and those reasons are not 
    necessarily reported to the Federal Government. Not all firearms 
    used in crime are traced and not all firearms traced are used in 
    crime.
        (2) Firearms selected for tracing are not chosen for purposes 
    of determining which types, makes, or models of firearms are used 
    for illicit purposes. The firearms selected do not constitute a 
    random sample and should not be considered representative of the 
    larger universe of all firearms used by criminals, or any subset of 
    that universe. Firearms are normally traced to the first retail 
    seller, and sources reported for firearms traced do not necessarily 
    represent the sources or methods by which firearms in general are 
    acquired for use in crime.
    Sec. 517. (a) The Inspectors General of the Department of Commerce, 
the Department of Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the National Science Foundation, and the Legal Services 
Corporation shall conduct audits, pursuant to the Inspector General Act 
(5 U.S.C. App.), of grants or contracts for which funds are 
appropriated by this Act, and shall submit reports to Congress on the 
progress of such audits, which may include preliminary findings and a 
description of areas of particular interest, within 180 days after 
initiating such an audit and every 180 days thereafter until any such 
audit is completed.
    (b) Within 60 days after the date on which an audit described in 
subsection (a) by an Inspector General is completed, the Secretary, 
Attorney General, Administrator, Director, or President, as 
appropriate, shall make the results of the audit available to the 
public on the Internet website maintained by the Department, 
Administration, Foundation, or Corporation, respectively. The results 
shall be made available in redacted form to exclude--
        (1) any matter described in section 552(b) of title 5, United 
    States Code; and
        (2) sensitive personal information for any individual, the 
    public access to which could be used to commit identity theft or 
    for other inappropriate or unlawful purposes.
    (c) A grant or contract funded by amounts appropriated by this Act 
may not be used for the purpose of defraying the costs of a banquet or 
conference that is not directly and programmatically related to the 
purpose for which the grant or contract was awarded, such as a banquet 
or conference held in connection with planning, training, assessment, 
review, or other routine purposes related to a project funded by the 
grant or contract.
    (d) Any person awarded a grant or contract funded by amounts 
appropriated by this Act shall submit a statement to the Secretary of 
Commerce, the Attorney General, the Administrator, Director, or 
President, as appropriate, certifying that no funds derived from the 
grant or contract will be made available through a subcontract or in 
any other manner to another person who has a financial interest in the 
person awarded the grant or contract.
    (e) The provisions of the preceding subsections of this section 
shall take effect 30 days after the date on which the Director of the 
Office of Management and Budget, in consultation with the Director of 
the Office of Government Ethics, determines that a uniform set of rules 
and requirements, substantially similar to the requirements in such 
subsections, consistently apply under the executive branch ethics 
program to all Federal departments, agencies, and entities.
    Sec. 518.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
available under this Act may be used by the Departments of Commerce and 
Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the 
National Science Foundation to acquire information technology systems 
unless the respective Secretary or head of agency, in consultation with 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation or other appropriate Federal 
agencies, has assessed any associated risk of cyber-espionage or 
sabotage.
    Sec. 519.  None of the funds made available in this Act shall be 
used in any way whatsoever to support or justify the use of torture by 
any official or contract employee of the United States Government.
    Sec. 520. (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of law or treaty, 
none of the funds appropriated or otherwise made available under this 
Act or any other Act may be expended or obligated by a department, 
agency, or instrumentality of the United States to pay administrative 
expenses or to compensate an officer or employee of the United States 
in connection with requiring an export license for the export to Canada 
of components, parts, accessories or attachments for firearms listed in 
Category I, section 121.1 of title 22, Code of Federal Regulations 
(International Trafficking in Arms Regulations (ITAR), part 121, as it 
existed on April 1, 2005) with a total value not exceeding $500 
wholesale in any transaction, provided that the conditions of 
subsection (b) of this section are met by the exporting party for such 
articles.
    (b) The foregoing exemption from obtaining an export license--
        (1) does not exempt an exporter from filing any Shipper's 
    Export Declaration or notification letter required by law, or from 
    being otherwise eligible under the laws of the United States to 
    possess, ship, transport, or export the articles enumerated in 
    subsection (a); and
        (2) does not permit the export without a license of--
            (A) fully automatic firearms and components and parts for 
        such firearms, other than for end use by the Federal 
        Government, or a Provincial or Municipal Government of Canada;
            (B) barrels, cylinders, receivers (frames) or complete 
        breech mechanisms for any firearm listed in Category I, other 
        than for end use by the Federal Government, or a Provincial or 
        Municipal Government of Canada; or
            (C) articles for export from Canada to another foreign 
        destination.
    (c) In accordance with this section, the District Directors of 
Customs and postmasters shall permit the permanent or temporary export 
without a license of any unclassified articles specified in subsection 
(a) to Canada for end use in Canada or return to the United States, or 
temporary import of Canadian-origin items from Canada for end use in 
the United States or return to Canada for a Canadian citizen.
    (d) The President may require export licenses under this section on 
a temporary basis if the President determines, upon publication first 
in the Federal Register, that the Government of Canada has implemented 
or maintained inadequate import controls for the articles specified in 
subsection (a), such that a significant diversion of such articles has 
and continues to take place for use in international terrorism or in 
the escalation of a conflict in another nation. The President shall 
terminate the requirements of a license when reasons for the temporary 
requirements have ceased.
    Sec. 521.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, no 
department, agency, or instrumentality of the United States receiving 
appropriated funds under this Act or any other Act shall obligate or 
expend in any way such funds to pay administrative expenses or the 
compensation of any officer or employee of the United States to deny 
any application submitted pursuant to 22 U.S.C. 2778(b)(1)(B) and 
qualified pursuant to 27 CFR section 478.112 or .113, for a permit to 
import United States origin ``curios or relics'' firearms, parts, or 
ammunition.
    Sec. 522.  None of the funds made available in this Act may be used 
to include in any new bilateral or multilateral trade agreement the 
text of--
        (1) paragraph 2 of article 16.7 of the United States-Singapore 
    Free Trade Agreement;
        (2) paragraph 4 of article 17.9 of the United States-Australia 
    Free Trade Agreement; or
        (3) paragraph 4 of article 15.9 of the United States-Morocco 
    Free Trade Agreement.
    Sec. 523.  None of the funds made available in this Act may be used 
to authorize or issue a national security letter in contravention of 
any of the following laws authorizing the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation to issue national security letters: The Right to 
Financial Privacy Act; The Electronic Communications Privacy Act; The 
Fair Credit Reporting Act; The National Security Act of 1947; USA 
PATRIOT Act; and the laws amended by these Acts.
    Sec. 524.  If at any time during any quarter, the program manager 
of a project within the jurisdiction of the Departments of Commerce or 
Justice, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, or the 
National Science Foundation totaling more than $75,000,000 has 
reasonable cause to believe that the total program cost has increased 
by 10 percent, the program manager shall immediately inform the 
respective Secretary, Administrator, or Director. The Secretary, 
Administrator, or Director shall notify the House and Senate Committees 
on Appropriations within 30 days in writing of such increase, and shall 
include in such notice: the date on which such determination was made; 
a statement of the reasons for such increases; the action taken and 
proposed to be taken to control future cost growth of the project; 
changes made in the performance or schedule milestones and the degree 
to which such changes have contributed to the increase in total program 
costs or procurement costs; new estimates of the total project or 
procurement costs; and a statement validating that the project's 
management structure is adequate to control total project or 
procurement costs.

transfer of funds in this Act, for intelligence or intelligence related 
activities are deemed to be specifically authorized by the Congress for

Authorization Act for fiscal year 2012.

this Act, shall establish and maintain on the homepages of their 
Internet websites--
        (1) a direct link to the Internet Web sites of their Offices of 
    Inspectors General; and
        (2) a mechanism on the Offices of Inspectors General Web site 
    by which individuals may anonymously report cases of waste, fraud, 
    or abuse with respect to those Departments, agencies, and 
    commissions.
    Sec. 527.  None of the funds appropriated or otherwise made 
available by this Act may be used to enter into a contract in an amount 
greater than $5,000,000 or to award a grant in excess of such amount 
unless the prospective contractor or grantee certifies in writing to 
the agency awarding the contract or grant that, to the best of its 
knowledge and belief, the contractor or grantee has filed all Federal 
tax returns required during the three years preceding the 
certification, has not been convicted of a criminal offense under the 
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, and has not, more than 90 days prior to 
certification, been notified of any unpaid Federal tax assessment for 
which the liability remains unsatisfied, unless the assessment is the 
subject of an installment agreement or offer in compromise that has 
been approved by the Internal Revenue Service and is not in default, or 
the assessment is the subject of a non-frivolous administrative or 
judicial proceeding.

    amounts made available from the Highway Trust Fund (other than the 
    Mass Transit Account) for Federal-aid highways and highway safety 
    programs for previous fiscal years the funds for which are 
    allocated by the Secretary;

            (A) the obligation limitation for Federal-aid highways, 
        less the aggregate of amounts not distributed under paragraphs 
        (1) and (2), bears to
            (B) the total of the sums authorized to be appropriated for

        (other than sums authorized to be appropriated for provisions 
        of law described in paragraphs (1) through (9) of subsection 
        (b) and sums authorized to be appropriated for section 105 of

    be appropriated for that section for the fiscal year; and
        (B) distribute $2,000,000,000 for section 105 of title 23,

    program) that are apportioned by the Secretary under the Safe, 
    Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A 
    Legacy for Users and title 23, United States Code, in the ratio 
    that--
            (A) amounts authorized to be appropriated for such programs 
        that are apportioned to each State for such fiscal year, bear 
        to
            (B) the total of the amounts authorized to be appropriated 
        for such programs that are apportioned to all States for such 
        fiscal year.

    Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users, to the 
    extent that funds obligated in accordance with that section were 
    not subject to a limitation on obligations at the time at which the 
    funds were initially made available for obligation.
    (c) Redistribution of Unused Obligation Authority.--Notwithstanding 
subsection (a), the Secretary shall, after August 1 of such fiscal 
year, revise a distribution of the obligation limitation made available 
under subsection (a) if the amount distributed cannot be obligated 
during that fiscal year, and redistribute sufficient amounts to those

fiscal years and shall be in addition to the amount of any limitation 
imposed on obligations for Federal-aid highway and highway safety 
construction programs for future fiscal years.

        for Federal-aid highways programs; and
            (B) the Secretary determines will not be allocated to the

and (3) by leveraging other sources of funding to recapitalize 
properties:  Provided further, That the Secretary shall provide an

admission for any purpose, including compliance with income targeting 
requirements:  Provided further, That in the case of a property with 
assistance converted under the demonstration from assistance under 
section 9 of the Act, section 18 of the Act shall not apply to a 
property converting assistance under the demonstration for all or 
substantially all of its units, the Secretary shall require ownership 
or control of assisted units by a public or nonprofit entity except as 
determined by the Secretary to be necessary pursuant to foreclosure, 
bankruptcy, or termination and transfer of assistance for material

facilitate the use of tax credits only if the public housing agency 
preserves its interest in the property in a manner approved by the 
Secretary, and upon expiration of the initial contract and each renewal

Provided, That in addition, $80,000,000 shall be made available until

conditions:
        (1) The Neighborhood Reinvestment Corporation (``NRC'') shall 
    make grants to counseling intermediaries approved by the Department 
    of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) (with match to be determined 
    by the NRC based on affordability and the economic conditions of an 
    area; a match also may be waived by the NRC based on the 
    aforementioned conditions) to provide mortgage foreclosure 
    mitigation assistance primarily to States and areas with high rates 
    of defaults and foreclosures to help eliminate the default and 
    foreclosure of mortgages of owner-occupied single-family homes that 
    are at risk of such foreclosure. Other than areas with high rates 
    of defaults and foreclosures, grants may also be provided to 
    approved counseling intermediaries based on a geographic analysis 
    of the Nation by the NRC which determines where there is a 
    prevalence of mortgages that are risky and likely to fail, 
    including any trends for mortgages that are likely to default and 
    face foreclosure. A State Housing Finance Agency may also be 
    eligible where the State Housing Finance Agency meets all the 
    requirements under this paragraph. A HUD-approved counseling 
    intermediary shall meet certain mortgage foreclosure mitigation 
    assistance counseling requirements, as determined by the NRC, and 
    shall be approved by HUD or the NRC as meeting these requirements.
        (2) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance shall only be 
    made available to homeowners of owner-occupied homes with mortgages 
    in default or in danger of default. These mortgages shall likely be 
    subject to a foreclosure action and homeowners will be provided 
    such assistance that shall consist of activities that are likely to 
    prevent foreclosures and result in the long-term affordability of 
    the mortgage retained pursuant to such activity or another positive 
    outcome for the homeowner. No funds made available under this 
    paragraph may be provided directly to lenders or homeowners to 
    discharge outstanding mortgage balances or for any other direct 
    debt reduction payments.
        (3) The use of Mortgage Foreclosure Mitigation Assistance by 
    approved counseling intermediaries and State Housing Finance 
    Agencies shall involve a reasonable analysis of the borrower's 
    financial situation, an evaluation of the current value of the 
    property that is subject to the mortgage, counseling regarding the 
    assumption of the mortgage by another non-Federal party, counseling 
    regarding the possible purchase of the mortgage by a non-Federal 
    third party, counseling and advice of all likely restructuring and 
    refinancing strategies or the approval of a work-out strategy by 
    all interested parties.
        (4) NRC may provide up to 15 percent of the total funds under 
    this paragraph to its own charter members with expertise in 
    foreclosure prevention counseling, subject to a certification by 
    the NRC that the procedures for selection do not consist of any 
    procedures or activities that could be construed as an unacceptable 
    conflict of interest or have the appearance of impropriety.
        (5) HUD-approved counseling entities and State Housing Finance 
    Agencies receiving funds under this paragraph shall have 
    demonstrated experience in successfully working with financial 
    institutions as well as borrowers facing default, delinquency and 
    foreclosure as well as documented counseling capacity, outreach 
    capacity, past successful performance and positive outcomes with 
    documented counseling plans (including post mortgage foreclosure 
    mitigation counseling), loan workout agreements and loan 
    modification agreements. NRC may use other criteria to demonstrate 
    capacity in underserved areas.
        (6) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, up 
    to $3,000,000 may be made available to build the mortgage 
    foreclosure and default mitigation counseling capacity of 
    counseling intermediaries through NRC training courses with HUD-
    approved counseling intermediaries and their partners, except that 
    private financial institutions that participate in NRC training 
    shall pay market rates for such training.
        (7) Of the total amount made available under this paragraph, up 
    to 5 percent may be used for associated administrative expenses for 
    the NRC to carry out activities provided under this section.
        (8) Mortgage foreclosure mitigation assistance grants may 
    include a budget for outreach and advertising, and training, as 
    determined by the NRC.
        (9) The NRC shall continue to report bi-annually to the House 
    and Senate Committees on Appropriations as well as the Senate 
    Banking Committee and House Financial Services Committee on its 
    efforts to mitigate mortgage default.

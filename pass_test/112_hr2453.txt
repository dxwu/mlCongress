SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Mark Twain Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    The Congress finds as follows:
        (1) Samuel Clemens--better known to the world as Mark Twain--
    was a unique American voice whose literary work has had a lasting 
    effect on our Nation's history and culture.
        (2) Mark Twain remains one of the best known Americans in the 
    world with over 6,500 editions of his books translated into 75 
    languages.
        (3) Mark Twain's literary and educational legacy remains strong 
    even today, with nearly every book he wrote still in print, 
    including The Adventures of Tom Sawyer and Adventures of 
    Huckleberry Finn--both of which have never gone out of print since 
    they were first published over a century ago.
        (4) In the past 2 decades alone, there have been more than 100 
    books published and over 250 doctoral dissertations written on Mark 
    Twain's life and work.
        (5) Even today, Americans seek to know more about the life and 
    work of Mark Twain, as people from around the world and across all 
    50 States annually flock to National Historic Landmarks like the 
    Mark Twain House & Museum in Hartford, CT, and the Mark Twain 
    Boyhood Home & Museum in Hannibal, MO.
        (6) Mark Twain's work is remembered today for addressing the 
    complex social issues facing America at the turn of the century, 
    including the legacy of the Civil War, race relations, and the 
    economic inequalities of the ``Gilded Age''.
        (7) Today Mark Twain's work lives on through educational 
    institutions throughout the United States, such as the Mark Twain 
    Project at the Bancroft Library of the University of California, 
    Berkeley, California, and the Center for Mark Twain Studies at 
    Elmira College, in Elmira, New York.

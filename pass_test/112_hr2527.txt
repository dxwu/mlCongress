                                 An Act


 
 To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in recognition 
         and celebration of the National Baseball Hall of Fame.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``National Baseball Hall of Fame 
Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    The Congress finds the following:
        (1) On June 12, 1939, the National Baseball Hall of Fame and 
    Museum opened in Cooperstown, New York. Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, 
    Christy Mathewson, Babe Ruth, and Honus Wagner comprised the 
    inaugural class of inductees. This class set the standard for all 
    future inductees. Since 1939, just one percent of all Major League 
    Baseball players have earned induction into the National Baseball 
    Hall of Fame.
        (2) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is dedicated 
    to preserving history, honoring excellence, and connecting 
    generations through the rich history of our national pastime. 
    Baseball has mirrored our Nation's history since the Civil War, and 
    is now an integral part of our Nation's heritage.
        (3) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum chronicles 
    the history of our national pastime and houses the world's largest 
    collection of baseball artifacts, including more than 38,000 three 
    dimensional artifacts, 3,000,000 documents, 500,000 photographs, 
    and 12,000 hours of recorded media. This collection ensures that 
    baseball history and its unique connection to American history will 
    be preserved and recounted for future generations.
        (4) Since its opening in 1939, more than 14,000,000 baseball 
    fans have visited the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum to 
    learn about the history of our national pastime and the game's 
    connection to the American experience.
        (5) The National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum is an 
    educational institution, reaching 10,000,000 Americans annually. 
    Utilizing video conference technology, students and teachers 
    participate in interactive lessons led by educators from the 
    National Baseball Hall of Fame Museum. These award-winning 
    educational programs draw upon the wonders of baseball to reach 
    students in classrooms nationwide. Each educational program uses 
    baseball as a lens for teaching young Americans important lessons 
    on an array of topics, including mathematics, geography, civil 
    rights, women's history, economics, industrial technology, arts, 
    and communication.
SEC. 3. COIN SPECIFICATIONS.
    (a) Denominations.--In recognition and celebration of the National 
Baseball Hall of Fame, the Secretary of the Treasury (hereafter in this 
Act referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall mint and issue the 
following coins:
        (1) $5 gold coins.--Not more than 50,000 $5 coins, which 
    shall--
            (A) weigh 8.359 grams;
            (B) have diameter of 0.850 inches; and
            (C) contain 90 percent gold and 10 percent alloy.
        (2) $1 silver coins.--Not more than 400,000 $1 coins, which 
    shall--
            (A) weigh 26.73 grams;
            (B) have a diameter of 1.500 inches; and
            (C) contain 90 percent silver and 10 percent copper.
        (3) Half-dollar clad coins.--Not more than 750,000 half-dollar 
    coins which shall--
            (A) weigh 11.34 grams;
            (B) have a diameter of 1.205 inches; and
            (C) be minted to the specifications for half-dollar coins 
        contained in section 5112(b) of title 31, United States Code.
    (b) Legal Tender.--The coins minted under this Act shall be legal 
tender, as provided in section 5103 of title 31, United States Code.

considered to be numismatic items.
    (d) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that, to the 
extent possible without significantly adding to the purchase price of 
the coins, the $1 coins and $5 coins minted under this Act should be 
produced in a fashion similar to the 2009 International Year of 
Astronomy coins issued by Monnaie de Paris, the French Mint, so that 
the reverse of the coin is convex to more closely resemble a baseball 
and the obverse concave, providing a more dramatic display of the 
obverse design chosen pursuant to section 4(c).

        (3) the cost of designing and issuing the coins (including 
    labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, winning design 
    compensation, overhead expenses, marketing, and shipping).
    (b) Bulk Sales.--The Secretary shall make bulk sales of the coins

programs issued during such year to exceed the annual commemorative 
coin program issuance limitation under section 5112(m)(1) of title 31,

 and discretion in enforcing the consumer product safety laws, and for 
                             other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. LIMITATION ON LEAD IN CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS.
    (a) Prospective Application of Lead Limit for Children's 
Products.--Section 101(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Improvement 
Act of 2008 (15 U.S.C. 1278a(a)) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
        ``(3) Application.--Each limit set forth in paragraph (2) 
    (except for the limit set forth in subparagraphs (A) and (B)) shall 
    apply only to a children's product (as defined in section 3(a) of 
    the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 2052(a))) that is 
    manufactured after the effective date of such respective limit.''.
    (b) Alternative Limits and Exceptions.--Section 101(b) of such Act 
(15 U.S.C. 1278a(b)(1)) is amended--
        (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:
        ``(1) Functional purpose exception.--
            ``(A) In general.--The Commission, on its own initiative or 
        upon petition by an interested party, shall grant an exception 
        to the limit in subsection (a) for a specific product, class of 
        product, material, or component part if the Commission, after 
        notice and a hearing, determines that--
                ``(i) the product, class of product, material, or 
            component part requires the inclusion of lead because it is 
            not practicable or not technologically feasible to 
            manufacture such product, class of product, material, or 
            component part, as the case may be, in accordance with 
            subsection (a) by removing the excessive lead or by making 
            the lead inaccessible;
                ``(ii) the product, class of product, material, or 
            component part is not likely to be placed in the mouth or 
            ingested, taking into account normal and reasonably 
            foreseeable use and abuse of such product, class of 
            product, material, or component part by a child; and
                ``(iii) an exception for the product, class of product, 
            material, or component part will have no measurable adverse 
            effect on public health or safety, taking into account 
            normal and reasonably foreseeable use and abuse.
            ``(B) Measurement.--For purposes of subparagraph (A)(iii), 
        there is no measurable adverse effect on public health or 
        safety if the exception described in subparagraph (A) will 
        result in no measurable increase in blood lead levels of a 
        child. The Commission may adopt an alternative method of 
        measurement other than blood lead levels if it determines, 
        after notice and a hearing, that such alternative method is a 
        better scientific method for measuring adverse effect on public 
        health and safety.
            ``(C) Procedures for granting exception.--
                ``(i) Burden of proof.--A party seeking an exception 
            under subparagraph (A) has the burden of demonstrating that 
            it meets the requirements of such subparagraph.
                ``(ii) Grounds for decision.--In the case where a party 
            has petitioned for an exception, in determining whether to 
            grant the exception, the Commission may base its decision 
            solely on the materials presented by the party seeking the 
            exception and any materials received through notice and a 
            hearing.
                ``(iii) Admissible evidence.--In demonstrating that it 
            meets the requirements of subparagraph (A), a party seeking 
            an exception under such subparagraph may rely on any 
            nonproprietary information submitted by any other party 
            seeking such an exception and such information shall be 
            considered part of the record presented by the party that 
            relies on that information.
                ``(iv) Scope of exception.--If an exception is sought 
            for an entire product, the burden is on the petitioning 
            party to demonstrate that the criteria in subparagraph (A) 
            are met with respect to every accessible component or 
            accessible material of the product.
            ``(D) Limitation on exception.--If the Commission grants an 
        exception for a product, class of product, material, or 
        component part under subparagraph (A), the Commission may, as 
        necessary to protect public health or safety--
                ``(i) establish a lead limit that such product, class 
            of product, material, or component part may not exceed; or
                ``(ii) place a manufacturing expiration date on such 
            exception or establish a schedule after which the 
            manufacturer of such product, class of product, material, 
            or component part shall be in full compliance with the 
            limit established under clause (i) or the limit set forth 
            in subsection (a).
            ``(E) Application of exception.--An exception under 
        subparagraph (A) for a product, class of product, material, or 
        component part shall apply regardless of the date of 
        manufacture unless the Commission expressly provides otherwise.
            ``(F) Previously submitted petitions.--A party seeking an 
        exception under this paragraph may rely on materials previously 
        submitted in connection with a petition for exclusion under 
        this section. In such cases, petitioners must notify the 
        Commission of their intent to rely on materials previously 
        submitted. Such reliance does not affect petitioners' 
        obligation to demonstrate that they meet all requirements of 
        this paragraph as required by subparagraph (C)(i).'';
        (2) in paragraph (2)(A), by striking ``include to,'' and 
    inserting ``include''; and
        (3) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (8) and 
    inserting after paragraph (4) the following:
        ``(5) Exception for off-highway vehicles.--
            ``(A) In general.--Subsection (a) shall not apply to an 
        off-highway vehicle.

        section, the term `off-highway vehicle'--

                    belts, and roll-over protective structure; and
                ``(ii) includes a snowmobile.
        ``(6) Bicycles and related products.--In lieu of the lead 
    limits established in subsection (a)(2), the limits set forth for 
    each respective material in the notice of the Commission entitled 
    `Notice of Stay of Enforcement Pertaining to Bicycles and Related 
    Products', published June 30, 2009 (74 Fed. Reg. 31254), shall 
    apply to any metal component part of the products to which the stay 
    of enforcement described in such notice applies, except that after 
    December 31, 2011, the limits set forth in such notice shall not be 
    more than 300 parts per million total lead content by weight for 
    any metal component part of the products to which such stay 
    pertains.
        ``(7) Exclusion of certain used children's products.--
            ``(A) General exclusion.--The lead limits established under 
        subsection (a) shall not apply to a used children's product.
            ``(B) Definition.--In this paragraph, the term `used 
        children's product' means a children's product (as defined in 
        section 3(a) of the Consumer Product Safety Act (15 U.S.C. 
        2052(a)) that was obtained by the seller for use and not for 
        the purpose of resale or was obtained by the seller, either 
        directly or indirectly, from a person who obtained such 
        children's product for use and not for the purpose of resale. 
        Such term also includes a children's product that was donated

SEC. 2. APPLICATION OF THIRD PARTY TESTING REQUIREMENTS.
    (a) In General.--Section 14(d) of the Consumer Product Safety Act 
(15 U.S.C. 2063(d)) is amended--
        (1) in paragraph (2)(B)(ii), by striking ``random'' and 
    inserting ``representative''; and
        (2) by adding at the end the following:
        ``(3) Reducing third party testing burdens.--
            ``(A) Assessment.--Not later than 60 days after the date of 
        enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall seek public 
        comment on opportunities to reduce the cost of third party 
        testing requirements consistent with assuring compliance with 
        any applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or 
        regulation. The request for public comment shall include the 
        following:
                ``(i) The extent to which the use of materials subject 
            to regulations of another government agency that requires 
            third party testing of those materials may provide 
            sufficient assurance of conformity with an applicable 
            consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation 
            without further third party testing.
                ``(ii) The extent to which modification of the 
            certification requirements may have the effect of reducing 
            redundant third party testing by or on behalf of 2 or more 
            importers of a product that is substantially similar or 
            identical in all material respects.

            number of different components subject to third party 
            testing may be evaluated to show compliance with an 
            applicable rule, ban, standard, or regulation by third 
            party testing of a subset of such components selected by a 
            third party conformity assessment body.

            substantial number of substantially similar products 
            subject to third party testing may reasonably make use of 
            sampling procedures that reduce the overall test burden 
            without compromising the benefits of third party testing.
                ``(v) The extent to which evidence of conformity with 
            other national or international governmental standards may 
            provide assurance of conformity to consumer product safety 
            rules, bans, standards, or regulations applicable under 
            this Act.
                ``(vi) The extent to which technology, other than the 
            technology already approved by the Commission, exists for 
            third party conformity assessment bodies to test or to 
            screen for testing consumer products subject to a third 
            party testing requirement.

        described in subparagraph (A), but not later than 1 year after 
        the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Commission shall 
        review the public comments and may prescribe new or revised 
        third party testing regulations if it determines that such 
        regulations will reduce third party testing costs consistent 
        with assuring compliance with the applicable consumer product 
        safety rules, bans, standards, and regulations.
            ``(C) Report.--If the Commission determines that it lacks

        the applicable consumer product safety rules, bans, standards, 
        and regulations, it shall transmit a report to Congress 
        reviewing those opportunities, along with any recommendations 
        for any legislation to permit such implementation.

            ``(A) Special consideration; exemption.--
                ``(i) Consideration; alternative requirements.--Subject 
            to subparagraph (C), in implementing third party testing 
            requirements under this section, the Commission shall take 
            into consideration any economic, administrative, or other 
            limits on the ability of small batch manufacturers to 
            comply with such requirements and shall, after notice and a 
            hearing, provide alternative testing requirements for 
            covered products manufactured by small batch manufacturers 
            in lieu of those required under subsection (a) or (b). Any 
            such alternative requirements shall provide for reasonable 
            methods to assure compliance with any applicable consumer 
            product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation. The 
            Commission may allow such alternative testing requirements 
            for small batch manufacturers with respect to a specific 
            product or product class or with respect to a specific 
            safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation, or portion 
            thereof.
                ``(ii) Exemption.--If the Commission determines that no 
            alternative testing requirement is available or 
            economically practicable, it shall exempt small batch 
            manufacturers from third party testing requirements under 
            subsections (a) and (b).
                ``(iii) Certification.--In lieu of or as part of any 
            alternative testing requirements provided under clause (i), 
            the Commission may allow certification of a product to an 
            applicable consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or 
            regulation, or portion thereof, based on documentation that 
            the product complies with another national or international 
            governmental standard or safety requirement that the 
            Commission determines is the same or more stringent than 
            the consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or 
            regulation, or portion thereof. Any such certification 
            shall only be allowed to the extent of the equivalency with 
            a consumer product safety rule, ban, standard, or 
            regulation and not to any other part of the consumer 
            product safety rule, ban, standard, or regulation.

            (C), and except where the Commission determines that the 
            manufacturer does not meet the definition of a small batch 
            manufacturer, for any small batch manufacturer registered 
            pursuant to subparagraph (B), the Commission may not 
            require third party testing of a covered product by a third 
            party conformity assessment body until the Commission has 
            provided either an alternative testing requirement or an 
            exemption in accordance with clause (i) or (ii), 
            respectively.
            ``(B) Registration.--Any small batch manufacturer that 
        utilizes alternative requirements or an exemption under this 
        paragraph shall register with the Commission prior to using 
        such alternative requirements or exemptions pursuant to any 
        guidelines issued by the Commission to carry out this 
        requirement.
            ``(C) Limitation.--The Commission shall not provide or 
        permit to continue in effect any alternative requirements or 
        exemption from third party testing requirements under this 
        paragraph where it determines, based on notice and a hearing, 
        that full compliance with subsection (a) or (b) is reasonably 
        necessary to protect public health or safety. The Commission 
        shall not provide any alternative requirements or exemption

            increase in the Consumer Price Index for all urban 
            consumers published by the Department of Labor.

        include all gross revenue from all sales of all consumer 
        products of each entity that controls, is controlled by, or is 
        under common control with such manufacturer. The Commission 
        shall take steps to ensure that all relevant business

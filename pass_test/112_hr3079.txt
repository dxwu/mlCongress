            formula contained in subparagraph (A) over--

                    (I) the fiscal year of the motor vehicle producer 
                to whom the automotive goods are sold,

        producer of an automotive good shall, consistent with the 
        provisions regarding allocation of costs provided for in 
        generally accepted accounting principles, determine the net 
        cost of the automotive good under subparagraph (B) by--
                (i) calculating the total cost incurred with respect to 
            all goods produced by the producer of the automotive good, 
            subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales 
            service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and 
            nonallowable interest costs that are included in the total 
            cost of all such goods, and then reasonably allocating the

            to all goods produced by that producer, reasonably 
            allocating the total cost to the automotive good, and then 
            subtracting any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales 
            service costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, and 
            nonallowable interest costs that are included in the 
            portion of the total cost allocated to the automotive good;

            of the total cost incurred with respect to the automotive 
            good so that the aggregate of these costs does not include 
            any sales promotion, marketing, and after-sales service 
            costs, royalties, shipping and packing costs, or 
            nonallowable interest costs.

        producer of the good, the adjusted value of the material;
            (B) in the case of a material acquired in the territory in

            use of the material in the production of the good, less the 
            value of renewable scrap or byproducts.
            (B) Nonoriginating material.--The following expenses, if 
        included in the value of a nonoriginating material calculated

    (a) Determination.--
        (1) In general.--If a positive determination is made under 
    section 321(b), the President shall determine whether, as a result 
    of the elimination of a duty under the Agreement, a Panamanian 
    textile or apparel article is being imported into the United States 
    in such increased quantities, in absolute terms or relative to the 
    domestic market for that article, and under such conditions as to 
    cause serious damage, or actual threat thereof, to a domestic 
    industry producing an article that is like, or directly competitive 
    with, the imported article.
        (2) Serious damage.--In making a determination under paragraph 
    (1), the President--
            (A) shall examine the effect of increased imports on the 
        domestic industry, as reflected in changes in such relevant 
        economic factors as output, productivity, utilization of 
        capacity, inventories, market share, exports, wages, 
        employment, domestic prices, profits, and investment, no one of 
        which is necessarily decisive; and
            (B) shall not consider changes in consumer preference or 
        changes in technology as factors supporting a determination of 
        serious damage or actual threat thereof.
        (3) Deadline for determination.--The President shall make the 
    determination under paragraph (1) not later than 30 days after the

    necessary to remedy or prevent the serious damage and to facilitate 
    adjustment by the domestic industry.
        (2) Nature of relief.--The relief that the President is 
    authorized to provide under this subsection with respect to imports

            (A) the column 1 general rate of duty imposed under the HTS 
        on like articles at the time the import relief is provided; or

provided under section 322 is less than 3 years, the President may 
extend the effective period of any import relief provided under that 
section, subject to the limitation set forth in subsection (a), if the 
President determines that--
        (1) the import relief continues to be necessary to remedy or 
    prevent serious damage and to facilitate adjustment by the domestic 
    industry to import competition; and
        (2) there is evidence that the industry is making a positive 
    adjustment to import competition.

    SEC. 325. RATE AFTER TERMINATION OF IMPORT RELIEF.

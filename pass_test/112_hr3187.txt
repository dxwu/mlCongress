United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``March of Dimes Commemorative Coin 
Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    The Congress finds the following:
        (1) President Franklin Roosevelt's personal struggle with polio 
    led him to create the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis 
    (now known as the March of Dimes) on January 3, 1938, at a time 
    when polio was on the rise.
        (2) The Foundation established patient aid programs and funded 
    research for polio vaccines developed by Jonas Salk, MD, and Albert 
    Sabin, MD.
        (3) Tested in a massive field trial in 1954 that involved 1.8 
    million schoolchildren known as ``polio pioneers'', the Salk 
    vaccine was licensed for use on April 12, 1955 as ``safe, 
    effective, and potent''. The Salk and Sabin polio vaccines funded 
    by the March of Dimes ended the polio epidemic in the United 
    States.
        (4) With its original mission accomplished, the Foundation 
    turned its focus to preventing birth defects, prematurity, and 
    infant mortality in 1958. The Foundation began to fund research 
    into the genetic, prenatal, and environmental causes of over 3,000 
    birth defects.
        (5) The Foundation's investment in research has led to 13 
    scientists winning the Nobel Prize since 1954, including Dr. James 
    Watson's discovery of the double helix.
        (6) Virginia Apgar, MD, creator of the Apgar Score, helped 
    develop the Foundation's mission for birth defects prevention; 
    joining the Foundation as the head of its new birth defects 
    division in 1959.
        (7) In the 1960s, the Foundation created over 100 birth defects 
    treatment centers, and then turned its attention to assisting in 
    the development of Neonatal Intensive Care Units, or NICUs.
        (8) With March of Dimes support, a Committee on Perinatal 
    Health released Toward Improving the Outcome of Pregnancy in 1976, 
    which included recommendations that led to the regionalization of 
    perinatal health care in the United States.
        (9) Since 1998, the March of Dimes has advocated for and 
    witnessed the passage of the Birth Defects Prevention Act, 
    Children's Health Act, PREEMIE Act, and Newborn Screening Save 
    Lives Act.
        (10) In 2003, the March of Dimes launched a Prematurity 
    Campaign to increase awareness about and reduce the incidence of 
    preterm birth, infant mortality, birth defects, and lifelong 
    disabilities and disorders.
        (11) The March of Dimes actively promotes programs for and 
    funds research into newborn screening, pulmonary surfactant 
    therapy, maternal nutrition, smoking cessation, folic acid 
    consumption to prevent neural tube defects, increased access to 
    maternity care, and similar programs to improve maternal and infant 
    health.

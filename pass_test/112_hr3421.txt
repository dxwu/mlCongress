  To award Congressional Gold Medals in honor of the men and women who 
 perished as a result of the terrorist attacks on the United States on 
                           September 11, 2001.

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Heroes of 9/11 Act''.
SEC. 2. CONGRESSIONAL FINDINGS.
    Congress finds that--
        (1) the tragic deaths at the World Trade Center, at the 
    Pentagon, and in rural Pennsylvania on September 11, 2001, have 
    forever changed our Nation;
        (2) the officers, emergency workers, and other employees of 
    State and local government agencies, including the Port Authority 
    of New York and New Jersey, and of the United States government and 
    others, who responded to the attacks on the World Trade Center in 
    New York City and perished as a result of the tragic events of 
    September 11, 2001 (including those who are missing and presumed 
    dead), took heroic and noble action on that day;
        (3) the officers, emergency rescue workers, and employees of 
    local and United States government agencies, who responded to the 
    attack on the Pentagon in Washington, DC, took heroic and noble 
    action to evacuate the premises and prevent further casualties of 
    Pentagon employees;
        (4) the passengers and crew of United Airlines Flight 93, 
    recognizing the imminent danger that the aircraft that they were 
    aboard posed to large numbers of innocent men, women and children, 
    American institutions, and the symbols of American democracy, took 
    heroic and noble action to ensure that the aircraft could not be 
    used as a weapon; and
        (5) given the unprecedented nature of the attacks against the 
    United States of America and the need to properly demonstrate the 
    support of the country for those who lost their lives to terrorism, 
    it is fitting that their sacrifice be recognized with the award of 
    an appropriate medal.

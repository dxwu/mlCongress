        decimalization. The study shall examine the impact that 
        decimalization has had on the number of initial public 
        offerings since its implementation relative to the period 
        before its implementation. The study shall also examine the 
        impact that this change has had on liquidity for small and 
        middle capitalization company securities and whether there is 
        sufficient economic incentive to support trading operations in 
        these securities in penny increments. Not later than 90 days 
        after the date of enactment of this paragraph, the Commission 
        shall submit to Congress a report on the findings of the study.

        Commission may, by rule not later than 180 days after the date 
        of enactment of this paragraph, designate a minimum increment 
        for the securities of emerging growth companies that is greater

    (a) In General.--With respect to an exemption provided to emerging 
growth companies under this title, or an amendment made by this title, 
an emerging growth company may choose to forgo such exemption and 
instead comply with the requirements that apply to an issuer that is 
not an emerging growth company.
    (b) Special Rule.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), with respect to 
the extension of time to comply with new or revised financial 
accounting standards provided under section 7(a)(2)(B) of the 
Securities Act of 1933 and section 13(a) of the Securities Exchange Act 
of 1934, as added by section 102(b), if an emerging growth company 
chooses to comply with such standards to the same extent that a non-
emerging growth company is required to comply with such standards, the 
emerging growth company--
        (1) must make such choice at the time the company is first 
    required to file a registration statement, periodic report, or 
    other report with the Commission under section 13 of the Securities 
    Exchange Act of 1934 and notify the Securities and Exchange 
    Commission of such choice;
        (2) may not select some standards to comply with in such manner

    extent that a non-emerging growth company is required to comply 
    with such standards; and

    extent that a non-emerging growth company is required to comply

    growth company.

        (1) comprehensively analyze the current registration 
    requirements of such regulation; and
        (2) determine how such requirements can be updated to modernize

    Regulations, to provide that the prohibition against general 
    solicitation or general advertising contained in section 230.502(c) 
    of such title shall not apply to offers and sales of securities 
    made pursuant to section 230.506, provided that all purchasers of 
    the securities are accredited investors. Such rules shall require 
    the issuer to take reasonable steps to verify that purchasers of 
    the securities are accredited investors, using such methods as

    Act, the Securities and Exchange Commission shall revise subsection 
    (d)(1) of section 230.144A of title 17, Code of Federal 
    Regulations, to provide that securities sold under such revised 
    exemption may be offered to persons other than qualified 
    institutional buyers, including by means of general solicitation or 
    general advertising, provided that securities are sold only to 
    persons that the seller and any person acting on behalf of the 
    seller reasonably believe is a qualified institutional buyer.

    ``(b) Offers and sales exempt under section 230.506 of title 17, 
Code of Federal Regulations (as revised pursuant to section 201 of the 
Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act) shall not be deemed public 
offerings under the Federal securities laws as a result of general

    investment advice or recommendations to issuers or investors; and

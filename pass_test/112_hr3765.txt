        ``(1) Guarantee fee.--The term `guarantee fee'--
            ``(A) means a fee described in subsection (b); and
            ``(B) includes--
                ``(i) the guaranty fee charged by the Federal National 
            Mortgage Association with respect to mortgage-backed 
            securities; and
                ``(ii) the management and guarantee fee charged by the 
            Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation with respect to 
            participation certificates.
        ``(2) Average fees.--The term `average fees' means the average 
    contractual fee rate of single-family guaranty arrangements by an 
    enterprise entered into during 2011, plus the recognition of any 
    up-front cash payments over an estimated average life, expressed in 
    terms of basis points. Such definition shall be interpreted in a 
    manner consistent with the annual report on guarantee fees by the 
    Federal Housing Finance Agency.
    ``(b) Increase.--
        ``(1) In general.--
            ``(A) Phased increase required.--Subject to subsection (c), 
        the Director shall require each enterprise to charge a 
        guarantee fee in connection with any guarantee of the timely 
        payment of principal and interest on securities, notes, and 
        other obligations based on or backed by mortgages on 
        residential real properties designed principally for occupancy 
        of from 1 to 4 families, consummated after the date of 
        enactment of this section.
            ``(B) Amount.--The amount of the increase required under 
        this section shall be determined by the Director to 
        appropriately reflect the risk of loss, as well the cost of 
        capital allocated to similar assets held by other fully private 
        regulated financial institutions, but such amount shall be not 
        less than an average increase of 10 basis points for each 
        origination year or book year above the average fees imposed in 
        2011 for such guarantees. The Director shall prohibit an 
        enterprise from offsetting the cost of the fee to mortgage 
        originators, borrowers, and investors by decreasing other 
        charges, fees, or premiums, or in any other manner.
        ``(2) Authority to limit offer of guarantee.--The Director 
    shall prohibit an enterprise from consummating any offer for a 
    guarantee to a lender for mortgage-backed securities, if--
            ``(A) the guarantee is inconsistent with the requirements 
        of this section; or
            ``(B) the risk of loss is allowed to increase, through 
        lowering of the underwriting standards or other means, for the 
        primary purpose of meeting the requirements of this section.
        ``(3) Deposit in treasury.--Amounts received from fee increases 
    imposed under this section shall be deposited directly into the 
    United States Treasury, and shall be available only to the extent 
    provided in subsequent appropriations Acts. The fees charged 
    pursuant to this section shall not be considered a reimbursement to 
    the Federal Government for the costs or subsidy provided to an 
    enterprise.
    ``(c) Phase-in.--
        ``(1) In general.--The Director may provide for compliance with 
    subsection (b) by allowing each enterprise to increase the 
    guarantee fee charged by the enterprise gradually over the 2-year 
    period beginning on the date of enactment of this section, in a 
    manner sufficient to comply with this section. In determining a 
    schedule for such increases, the Director shall--
            ``(A) provide for uniform pricing among lenders;
            ``(B) provide for adjustments in pricing based on risk 
        levels; and
            ``(C) take into consideration conditions in financial 
        markets.
        ``(2) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
    be interpreted to undermine the minimum increase required by 
    subsection (b).
    ``(d) Information Collection and Annual Analysis.--The Director 
shall require each enterprise to provide to the Director, as part of 
its annual report submitted to Congress--
        ``(1) a description of--
            ``(A) changes made to up-front fees and annual fees as part 
        of the guarantee fees negotiated with lenders;
            ``(B) changes to the riskiness of the new borrowers 
        compared to previous origination years or book years; and
            ``(C) any adjustments required to improve for future 
        origination years or book years, in order to be in complete 
        compliance with subsection (b); and
        ``(2) an assessment of how the changes in the guarantee fees 
    described in paragraph (1) met the requirements of subsection (b).
    ``(e) Enforcement.--
        ``(1) Required adjustments.--Based on the information from 
    subsection (d) and any other information the Director deems 
    necessary, the Director shall require an enterprise to make 
    adjustments in its guarantee fee in order to be in compliance with 
    subsection (b).
        ``(2) Noncompliance penalty.--An enterprise that has been found 
    to be out of compliance with subsection (b) for any 2 consecutive 
    years shall be precluded from providing any guarantee for a period, 
    determined by rule of the Director, but in no case less than 1 
    year.
        ``(3) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall 
    be interpreted as preventing the Director from initiating and 
    implementing an enforcement action against an enterprise, at a time 
    the Director deems necessary, under other existing enforcement 
    authority.
    ``(f) Expiration.--The provisions of this section shall expire on 
October 1, 2021.''.

    and (B), the Secretary shall establish and collect annual premium 
    payments for any mortgage for which the Secretary collects an 
    annual premium payment under subparagraph (B), in an amount 
    described in clause (ii).
        ``(ii)(I) Subject to subclause (II), with respect to a 
    mortgage, the amount described in this clause is 10 basis points of 
    the remaining insured principal balance (excluding the portion of 
    the remaining balance attributable to the premium collected under 
    subparagraph (A) and without taking into account delinquent 
    payments or prepayments).
        ``(II) During the 2-year period beginning on the date of 
    enactment of this subparagraph, the Secretary shall increase the 
    number of basis points of the annual premium payment collected 
    under this subparagraph incrementally, as determined appropriate by 
    the Secretary, until the number of basis points of the annual 
    premium payment collected under this subparagraph is equal to the 
    number described in subclause (I).''.
    (b) Prospective Repeal.--Section 203(c)(2) of the National Housing 
Act (12 U.S.C. 1709(c)(2)) is amended by striking subparagraph (C), as 
added by subsection (a), effective on October 1, 2021.

        ``(1) In general.--When the Senate is considering a bill, 
    resolution, amendment, motion, amendment between the Houses, or 
    conference report, if a point of order is made by a Senator against 
    an emergency designation in that measure, that provision making 
    such a designation shall be stricken from the measure and may not

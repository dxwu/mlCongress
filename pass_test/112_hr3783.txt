                                 An Act


 
   To provide for a comprehensive strategy to counter Iran's growing 
 hostile presence and activity in the Western Hemisphere, and for other 
                                purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Countering Iran in the Western 
Hemisphere Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) The United States has vital political, economic, and 
    security interests in the Western Hemisphere.
        (2) Iran is pursuing cooperation with Latin American countries 
    by signing economic and security agreements in order to create a 
    network of diplomatic and economic relationships to lessen the blow 
    of international sanctions and oppose Western attempts to constrict 
    its ambitions.
        (3) According to the Department of State, Hezbollah, with Iran 
    as its state sponsor, is considered the ``most technically capable 
    terrorist group in the world'' with ``thousands of supporters, 
    several thousand members, and a few hundred terrorist operatives,'' 
    and officials from the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps 
    (IRGC) Qods Force have been working in concert with Hezbollah for 
    many years.
        (4) The IRGC's Qods Force has a long history of supporting 
    Hezbollah's military, paramilitary, and terrorist activities, 
    providing it with guidance, funding, weapons, intelligence, and 
    logistical support, and in 2007, the Department of the Treasury 
    placed sanctions on the IRGC and its Qods Force for their support 
    of terrorism and proliferation activities.
        (5) The IRGC's Qods Force stations operatives in foreign 
    embassies, charities, and religious and cultural institutions to 
    foster relationships, often building on existing socioeconomic ties 
    with the well established Shia Diaspora, and recent years have 
    witnessed an increased presence in Latin America.
        (6) According to the Department of Defense, the IRGC and its 
    Qods Force played a significant role in some of the deadliest 
    terrorist attacks of the past two decades, including the 1994 
    attack on the AMIA Jewish Community Center in Buenos Aires, by 
    generally directing or supporting the groups that actually executed 
    the attacks.
        (7) Reports of Iranian intelligence agents being implicated in 
    Hezbollah-linked activities since the early 1990s suggest direct 
    Iranian government support of Hezbollah activities in the Tri-
    Border Area of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay, and in the past 
    decade, Iran has dramatically increased its diplomatic missions to 
    Venezuela, Bolivia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Argentina, and Brazil. Iran 
    has built 17 cultural centers in Latin America, and it currently 
    maintains 11 embassies, up from 6 in 2005.
        (8) Hezbollah and other Iranian proxies with a presence in 
    Latin America have raised revenues through illicit activities, 
    including drug and arms trafficking, counterfeiting, money 
    laundering, forging travel documents, pirating software and music, 
    and providing haven and assistance to other terrorists transiting 
    the region.
        (9) Bolivia, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and Venezuela expressed 
    their intention to assist Iran in evading sanctions by signing a 
    statement supporting Iran's nuclear activities and announcing at a 
    2010 joint press conference in Tehran their determination to 
    ``continue and expand their economic ties to Iran'' with confidence 
    that ``Iran can give a crushing response to the threats and 
    sanctions imposed by the West and imperialism''.
        (10) The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration concluded in 2008 
    that almost one-half of the foreign terrorist organizations in the 
    world are linked to narcotics trade and trafficking, including 
    Hezbollah and Hamas.
        (11) In October 2011, the United States charged two men, 
    Manssor Arbabsiar, a United States citizen holding both Iranian and 
    United States passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an Iran-based member 
    of Iran's IRGC Qods Force, with conspiracy to murder a foreign 
    official using explosives in an act of terrorism. Arbabsiar 
    traveled to Mexico with the express intent to hire ``someone in the 
    narcotics business'' to carry out the assassination of the Saudi 
    Arabian Ambassador in the United States. While in the end, he only 
    engaged a U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency informant posing as an 
    associate of a drug trafficking cartel, Arbabsiar believed that he 
    was working with a member of a Mexican drug trafficking 
    organization and sought to send money to this individual in 
    installments and not in a single transfer.
        (12) In February 2011, actions by the Department of the 
    Treasury effectively shut down the Lebanese Canadian Bank. 
    Subsequent actions by the United States Government in connection 
    with the investigation into Lebanese Canadian Bank resulted in the 
    indictment in December 2011 of Ayman Joumaa, an individual of 
    Lebanese nationality, with citizenship in Lebanon and Colombia, and 
    with ties to Hezbollah, for trafficking cocaine to the Los Zetas 
    drug trafficking organization in Mexico City for sale in the United 
    States and for laundering the proceeds.
SEC. 3. STATEMENT OF POLICY.
     It shall be the policy of the United States to use a comprehensive 
government-wide strategy to counter Iran's growing hostile presence and

Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC's Qods Force, and Hezbollah.

the initial pleading is not removable, a notice of removal may be filed

plaintiff has acted in bad faith in order to prevent a defendant from 
removing the action.

jurisdiction conferred by section 1332(a), the sum demanded in good 
faith in the initial pleading shall be deemed to be the amount in 
controversy, except that--
        ``(A) the notice of removal may assert the amount in 
    controversy if the initial pleading seeks--

        not permit demand for a specific sum or permits recovery of 
        damages in excess of the amount demanded; and

    in controversy asserted under subparagraph (A) if the district 
    court finds, by the preponderance of the evidence, that the amount 
    in controversy exceeds the amount specified in section 1332(a).
    ``(3)(A) If the case stated by the initial pleading is not 
removable solely because the amount in controversy does not exceed the 
amount specified in section 1332(a), information relating to the amount 
in controversy in the record of the State proceeding, or in responses 
to discovery, shall be treated as an `other paper' under subsection 
(b)(3).

commencement of the action and the district court finds that the 
plaintiff deliberately failed to disclose the actual amount in 
controversy to prevent removal, that finding shall be deemed bad faith 
under paragraph (1).''.

district court of the United States for the district and division 
within which such prosecution is pending a notice of removal signed 
pursuant to Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and

prosecution shall be filed not later than 30 days after the arraignment 
in the State court, or at any time before trial, whichever is earlier, 
except that for good cause shown the United States district court may 
enter an order granting the defendant or defendants leave to file the 
notice at a later time.
    ``(2) A notice of removal of a criminal prosecution shall include 
all grounds for such removal. A failure to state grounds that exist at 
the time of the filing of the notice shall constitute a waiver of such 
grounds, and a second notice may be filed only on grounds not existing 
at the time of the original notice. For good cause shown, the United 
States district court may grant relief from the limitations of this 
paragraph.
    ``(3) The filing of a notice of removal of a criminal prosecution 
shall not prevent the State court in which such prosecution is pending 
from proceeding further, except that a judgment of conviction shall not 
be entered unless the prosecution is first remanded.
    ``(4) The United States district court in which such notice is 
filed shall examine the notice promptly. If it clearly appears on the 
face of the notice and any exhibits annexed thereto that removal should 
not be permitted, the court shall make an order for summary remand.
    ``(5) If the United States district court does not order the 
summary remand of such prosecution, it shall order an evidentiary 
hearing to be held promptly and, after such hearing, shall make such 
disposition of the prosecution as justice shall require. If the United 
States district court determines that removal shall be permitted, it 
shall so notify the State court in which prosecution is pending, which 
shall proceed no further.
    ``(c) Writ of Habeas Corpus.--If the defendant or defendants are in 
actual custody on process issued by the State court, the district court 
shall issue its writ of habeas corpus, and the marshal shall thereupon 
take such defendant or defendants into the marshal's custody and 
deliver a copy of the writ to the clerk of such State court.''.

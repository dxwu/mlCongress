and sustainment strategy for the Littoral Combat Ship program, 
including manning, training, maintenance, and logistics support.
    (c) Cooperation.--For purposes of conducting the review under 
subsection (a) and the report under subsection (b), the Secretary of 
Defense shall ensure that the Comptroller General has access to--
        (1) all relevant records of the Department; and
        (2) all relevant communications between Department officials, 
    whether such communications occurred inside or outside the Federal 
    Government.
    SEC. 129. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON IMPORTANCE OF ENGINEERING IN EARLY 
      STAGES OF SHIPBUILDING.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) placing a priority on engineering dollars in the early 
    stages of shipbuilding programs is a vital component of keeping 
    cost down; and
        (2) therefore, the Secretary of the Navy should take 
    appropriate steps to prioritize early engineering in large ship 
    construction including amphibious class ships beginning with the 
    LHA-8.
    SEC. 130. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON NUCLEAR-POWERED BALLISTIC 
      SUBMARINES.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the continuous at-sea deterrence provided by a robust and 
    modern fleet of nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines is 
    critical to maintaining nuclear deterrence and assurance and 
    therefore is a central pillar of the national security of the 
    United States;
        (2) the Navy should--
            (A) carry out a program to replace the Ohio class ballistic 
        missile submarines;
            (B) ensure that the first such replacement submarine is 
        delivered and fully operational by not later than 2031 in order 
        to maintain continuous at-sea deterrence; and
            (C) develop a risk mitigation plan to ensure that robust 
        continuous at-sea deterrence is provided during the transition 
        from Ohio class ballistic missile submarines to the replacement 
        submarines; and
        (3) a minimum of 12 replacement ballistic missile submarines 
    are necessary to provide continuous at-sea deterrence over the 
    lifetime of such submarines and, therefore, the Navy should carry 
    out a program to produce 12 such submarines.
    SEC. 131. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MARINE CORPS AMPHIBIOUS LIFT AND 
      PRESENCE REQUIREMENTS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) The Marine Corps is a combat force that leverages maneuver 
    from the sea as a force multiplier allowing for a variety of 
    operational tasks ranging from major combat operations to 
    humanitarian assistance.
        (2) The Marine Corps is unique in that, while embarked upon 
    naval vessels, they bring all the logistic support necessary for 
    the full range of military operations and, operating ``from the 
    sea'', they require no third-party host nation permission to 
    conduct military operations.
        (3) The Navy has a requirement for 38 amphibious assault ships 
    to meet this full range of military operations.
        (4) Due only to fiscal constraints, that requirement of 38 
    vessels was reduced to 33 vessels, which adds military risk to 
    future operations.
        (5) The Navy has been unable to meet even the minimal 
    requirement of 30 operationally available vessels and has submitted 
    a shipbuilding and ship retirement plan to Congress that will 
    reduce the force to 28 vessels.
        (6) Experience has shown that early engineering and design of 
    naval vessels has significantly reduced the acquisition costs and 
    life-cycle costs of those vessels.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Department of Defense should carefully evaluate the 
    maritime force structure necessary to execute demand for forces by 
    the commanders of the combatant commands;
        (2) the Navy should carefully evaluate amphibious lift 
    capabilities to meet current and projected requirements;
        (3) the Navy should consider prioritization of investment in 
    and procurement of the next generation of amphibious assault ships 
    as a component of the balanced battle force;
        (4) the next generation amphibious assault ships should 
    maintain survivability protection;
        (5) operation and maintenance requirements analysis, as well as 
    the potential to leverage a common hull form design, should be 
    considered to reduce total ownership cost and acquisition cost; and
        (6) maintaining a robust amphibious ship building industrial 
    base is vital for the future of the national security of the United 
    States.
    SEC. 132. SENSE OF THE SENATE ON DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY FISCAL YEAR 
      2014 BUDGET REQUEST FOR TACTICAL AVIATION AIRCRAFT.
    It is the sense of the Senate that, if the budget request of the 
Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-18 aircraft includes 
a request for funds for more than 13 new F-18 aircraft, the budget 
request of the Department of the Navy for fiscal year 2014 for F-35 
aircraft should include a request for funds for not fewer than six F-
35B aircraft and four F-35C aircraft, presuming that development, 
testing, and production of the F-35 aircraft are proceeding according 
to current plans.

    midcourse defense system if planned flight tests CTV-01 and FTG-06b 
    do not demonstrate the successful correction to the problem that 
    caused the failure of the capability enhancement-2 kill vehicle in 
    flight test FTG-06a in December 2010, including additional testing 
    of the capability enhancement-1 kill vehicle.
        (2) An assessment of the feasibility, advisability, and cost 
    effectiveness (including the potential benefits, risks, and impact 
    on the current test plan and integrated master test plan for the 
    ground-based midcourse defense system) of adjusting the test plan 
    of the ground-based midcourse defense system to accomplish, at an 
    acceptable level of risk--
            (A) accelerating to fiscal year 2014 the date for testing 
        such system using a capability enhancement-1 kill vehicle 
        against an intercontinental ballistic missile-range target; and
            (B) increasing the pace of the flight testing of such 
        system to a rate of three tests every two years.
        (3) If the Secretary determines that either option described in 
    subparagraph (A) or (B) of paragraph (2) would be feasible, 
    advisable, and cost effective, a discussion of whether increased 
    funding beyond the funding requested in the budget for fiscal year 
    2013 is required to carry out such options and, if so, what level 
    of increased funding would be necessary to carry out each such 
    option.
        (4) Any additional matters the Secretary determines 
    appropriate.
    (c) DOT&E Views.--The Secretary shall include an appendix to the 
report under subsection (a) that contains the views of the Director of

United States shall--
        (1) brief the congressional defense committees concerning the 
    views of the Comptroller General on the report required under 
    subsection (a) by not later than 60 days after the date on which 
    the Secretary submits such report; and
        (2) submit to such committees a written report on such views as 
    soon as practicable after the date of the briefing under paragraph 
    (1).
    SEC. 232. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON MISSILE DEFENSE.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the Senate leadership, 
    President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
    (NATO) ``invited the Russian Federation to cooperate on missile 
    defense, which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those 
    deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against common 
    threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the Alliance's 
    missile defenses can be strengthened by improving NATO-Russian 
    relations. This comes even as we have made it clear that the system 
    we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a joint system, and it 
    will not in any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense 
    capabilities.''.
        (2) In a February 2, 2011, message to the Senate concerning its 
    December 22, 2010, Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification 
    of the New START Treaty, President Obama certified that ``It is the 
    policy of the United States to continue development and deployment 
    of United States missile defense systems to defend against missile 
    threats from nations such as North Korea and Iran, including 
    qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems. As 
    stated in the Resolution, such systems include all phases of the 
    Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense in Europe, the 
    modernization of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, and the 
    continued development of the two-stage Ground-Based Interceptor as 
    a technological and strategic hedge.''.
        (3) In a letter dated December 13, 2011, to Senator Mark Kirk, 
    Robert Nabors, Assistant to the President and Director of the 
    Office of Legislative Affairs, wrote that ``The United States 
    remains committed to implementing the European Phased Adaptive 
    Approach to missile defense, and will not agree to any constraints 
    limiting the development or deployment of United States missile 
    defenses'' and ``[w]e will not provide Russia with sensitive 
    information about our missile defense systems that would in any way 
    compromise our national security. For example, hit-to-kill 
    technology and interceptor telemetry will under no circumstances be 
    provided to Russia.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) pursuant to section 2 of the National Missile Defense Act 
    of 1999 (Public Law 106-38; 113 Stat. 205; 10 U.S.C. 2431 note), it 
    is the policy of the United States ``to deploy as soon as is 
    technologically possible an effective National Missile Defense 
    system capable of defending the territory of the United States 
    against limited ballistic missile attack (whether accidental, 
    unauthorized, or deliberate)...'';
        (2) defenses against ballistic missiles are essential for new 
    deterrent strategies and for new strategies should deterrence fail;
        (3) further limitations on the missile defense capabilities of 
    the United States are not in the national security interest of the 
    United States;
        (4) the New Start Treaty and the April 7, 2010, unilateral 
    statement of the Russian Federation on missile defense do not limit 
    in any way, and shall not be interpreted as limiting, activities 
    that the Federal Government of the United States currently plans or 
    that might be required over the duration of the New START Treaty to 
    protect the United States pursuant to the National Missile Defense 
    Act of 1999, or to protect the Armed Forces of the United States 
    and allies of the United States from limited ballistic missile 
    attack, including further planned enhancements to the Ground-based 
    Midcourse Defense system and all phases of the Phased Adaptive 
    Approach to missile defense in Europe;
        (5) it was the Understanding of the Senate in its December 22, 
    2010, Resolution of Advice and Consent to Ratification of the New 
    START Treaty that, ``any additional New START Treaty limitations on 
    the deployment of missile defenses beyond those contained in 
    paragraph 3 of Article V, including any limitations agreed under 
    the auspices of the Bilateral Consultative Commission, would 
    require an amendment to the New START Treaty which may enter into 
    force for the United States only with the advice and consent of the 
    Senate, as set forth in Article II, section 2, clause 2 of the 
    Constitution of the United States''; and
        (6) section 303(b) of the Arms Control and Disarmament Act (22 
    U.S.C. 2573(b)) requires that ``no action shall be taken pursuant 
    to this or any other Act that would obligate the United States to 
    reduce or limit the Armed Forces or armaments of the United States 
    in a militarily significant manner, except pursuant to the treaty-
    making power of the President set forth in Article II, Section 2, 
    Clause 2 of the Constitution.''.
    (c) New START Treaty Defined.--In this section, the term ``New 
START Treaty'' means the Treaty between the United States of America 
and the Russian Federation on Measures for the Further Reduction and 
Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms, signed on April 8, 2010, and 
entered into force on February 5, 2011.
    SEC. 233. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE SUBMITTAL TO CONGRESS OF THE 
      HOMELAND DEFENSE HEDGING POLICY AND STRATEGY REPORT OF THE 
      SECRETARY OF DEFENSE.
    It is the sense of the Congress that--
        (1) the homeland defense hedging policy and strategy report 
    required by section 233 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
    for Fiscal Year 2012 (Public Law 112-81; 125 Stat. 1340) is 
    necessary to inform Congress on options to protect the United 
    States homeland against the evolving ballistic missile threat, 
    including potential options prior to the deployment of Phase 4 of 
    the European Phased Adaptive Approach to missile defense; and
        (2) the Secretary of Defense should comply with the 
    requirements of such section 233 by submitting the homeland defense 
    hedging policy and strategy report to Congress.

            (B) closely weigh its recommendations regarding the web of 
        interrelated programs supporting spouses and families of

    time under paragraph (b)(2)(B), not later than 30 days after the 
    expiration of the extension of time, and there is no showing that 
    such delay is due to the bad faith of the complainant, the

    bring a de novo action at law or equity against the contractor or 
    grantee to seek compensatory damages and other relief available 
    under this section in the appropriate district court of the United 
    States, which shall have jurisdiction over such an action without 
    regard to the amount in controversy. Such an action shall, at the 
    request of either party to the action, be tried by the court with a

    this paragraph, the court may grant appropriate relief, including 
    injunctive relief, compensatory and exemplary damages, and attorney

    the order to have occurred. No petition seeking such review may be 
    filed more than 60 days after issuance of the order by the head of 
    the executive agency. Review shall conform to chapter 7 of title 5. 
    Filing such an appeal shall not act to stay the enforcement of the 
    order of the head of an executive agency, unless a stay is 
    specifically entered by the court.
        ``(6) Burdens of proof.--The legal burdens of proof specified 
    in section 1221(e) of title 5 shall be controlling for the purposes

            overt, though clandestine, cyber operations under title 10, 
            United States Code, and serve as the head of an element of 
            the intelligence community that conducts covert cyber 
            operations under the National Security Act of 1947 (50 
            U.S.C. 401 et seq.) in a manner that affords deniability to 
            the United States; and
                (ii) a statement of whether the Secretary believes it 
            is appropriate either to appoint a line officer as the

            unprecedented step of appointing an intelligence officer as 
            a unified commander; and
        (5) appropriate policy foundations and standing rules of 
    engagement must be in place before any decision to create a unified 
    United States Cyber Command.

    (b) Savings.--The plan required under subsection (a) shall achieve 
savings in the total funding for each workforce covered by such plan 
over the period from fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2017 that are 
not less, as a percentage of such funding, than the savings in funding 
for basic military personnel pay achieved from reductions in military 
end strengths over the same period of time.
    (c) Exclusions.--In developing and implementing the plan required 
by subsection (a) and achieving the savings percentages required by 
subsection (b), the Secretary of Defense may exclude expenses related 
to the performance of functions identified as core or critical to the 
mission of the Department, consistent with the workload analysis and 
risk assessments required by sections 129 and 129a of title 10, United 
States Code. In making a determination of core or critical functions, 
the Secretary shall consider at least the following:
        (1) Civilian personnel expenses for personnel as follows:
            (A) Personnel in Mission Critical Occupations, as defined 
        by the Civilian Human Capital Strategic Plan of the Department 
        of Defense and the Acquisition Workforce Plan of the Department 
        of Defense.

        equipment.
            (B) Personnel providing medical services.
            (C) Personnel performing financial audit services.
        (3) Personnel expenses for personnel in the civilian personnel 
    workforce or service contractor workforce performing such other 
    critical functions as may be identified by the Secretary as 
    requiring exemption in the interest of the national defense.
    (d) Reports.--
        (1) Initial report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of 
    the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to 
    the congressional defense committees a report including a 
    comprehensive description of the plan required by subsection (a).
        (2) Status reports.--As part of the budget submitted by the 
    President to Congress for each of fiscal years 2015 through 2018, 
    the Secretary shall include a report describing the implementation 
    of the plan during the prior fiscal year and any modifications to 
    the plan required due to changing circumstances. Each such report 
    shall include a summary of the savings achieved in such prior 
    fiscal year through reductions in the military, civilian, and 
    service contractor personnel workforces, and the number of 
    military, civilian, and service contractor personnel reduced. In

    report shall include an explanation of the reasons for such 
    shortfall.

    (e) Limitation on Transfers of Functions.--The Secretary shall 
ensure that the savings required by this section are not achieved 
through unjustified transfers of functions between or among the 
military, civilian, and service contractor personnel workforces of the 
Department of Defense. Nothing in this section shall be construed to 
preclude the Secretary from exercising authority available to the 
Department under sections 129a, 2330a, 2461, and 2463 of title 10, 
United States Code.
    (f) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that an amount 
equal to 30 percent of the amount of the reductions in appropriated 
funds attributable to reduced budgets for the civilian and service 
contractor workforces of the Department by reason of the plan required 
by subsection (a) should be made available for costs of assisting 
military personnel separated from the Armed Forces in the transition 
from military service.
    (g) Service Contractor Workforce Defined.--In this section, the 
term ``service contractor workforce'' means contractor employees 
performing contract services, as defined in section 2330(c)(2) of title 
10, United States Code, other than contract services that are funded 
out of amounts available for overseas contingency operations.

from fiscal year 2015 through fiscal year 2018, the Comptroller General 
of the United States shall review the status reports submitted by the 
Secretary as required by subsection (d)(2) to determine whether the 
savings required by subsection (b) are being achieved in the civilian 
personnel workforce and the service contractor workforce and whether 
the plan required under subsection (a) is being implemented consistent 
with sourcing and workforce management laws, including sections 129, 
129a, 2330a, 2461, and 2463 of title 10, United States Code. The

SEC. 1017. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON RECAPITALIZATION FOR THE NAVY AND COAST 
GUARD.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) More than 70 percent of the world's surface is comprised of 
    navigable oceans.
        (2) More than 80 percent of the population of the world lives 
    within 100 miles of an ocean.
        (3) More than 90 percent of the world's commerce traverses an 
    ocean.
        (4) The national security of the United States is inextricably 
    linked to the maintenance of global freedom of access for both the 
    strategic and commercial interests of the United States.
        (5) To maintain that freedom of access the sea services of the 
    United States, composed of the Navy, the Marine Corps, and the 
    Coast Guard, must be sufficiently positioned as rotationally 
    globally deployable forces with the capability to decisively defend 
    United States citizens, homeland, and interests abroad from direct 
    or asymmetric attack and must be comprised of sufficient vessels to 
    maintain global freedom of action.
        (6) To achieve appropriate capabilities to ensure national 
    security, the Government of the United States must continue to 
    recapitalize the fleets of the Navy and Coast Guard and must 
    continue to conduct vital maintenance and repair of existing 
    vessels to ensure such vessels meet service life goals.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the sea services of the United States should be funded and 
    maintained to provide the broad spectrum of capabilities required 
    to protect the national security of the United States;
        (2) such capabilities should include--
            (A) the ability to project United States power rapidly 
        anywhere on the globe without the need for host nation basing 
        permission or long and potentially vulnerable logistics supply 
        lines;
            (B) the ability to land and recover maritime forces from 
        the sea for direct combat action, to evacuate United States 
        citizens from hostile situations, and to provide humanitarian 
        assistance where needed;
            (C) the ability to operate from the subsurface with 
        overpowering conventional combat power, as well as strategic 
        deterrence; and
            (D) the ability to operate in collaboration with United 
        States maritime partners in the common interest of preventing 
        piracy at sea and maintaining the commercial sea lanes 
        available for global commerce;
        (3) the Secretary of Defense, in coordination with the 
    Secretary of the Navy, should maintain the recapitalization plans 
    for the Navy as a priority in all future force structure decisions; 
    and
        (4) the Secretary of Homeland Security should maintain the 
    recapitalization plans for the Coast Guard as a priority in all 
    future force structure decisions.
SEC. 1018. NOTICE TO CONGRESS FOR THE REVIEW OF PROPOSALS TO NAME NAVAL 
VESSELS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The Navy traces its ancestry to October 13, 1775, when an 
    Act of the Continental Congress authorized the first vessel of a 
    navy for the United Colonies. Vessels of the Continental Navy were 
    named for early patriots and military heroes, Federal institutions, 
    colonial cities, and positive character traits representative of 
    naval and military virtues.
        (2) An Act of Congress on March 3, 1819, made the Secretary of 
    the Navy responsible for assigning names to vessels of the Navy. 
    Traditional sources for vessel names customarily encompassed such 
    categories as geographic locations in the United States; historic 
    sites, battles, and ships; naval and military heroes and leaders; 
    and noted individuals who made distinguished contributions to 
    United States national security.
        (3) These customs and traditions provide appropriate and 
    necessary standards for the naming of vessels of the Navy.
    (b) Notice to Congress.--Section 7292 of title 10, United States 
Code, is amended by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(d)(1) The Secretary of the Navy may not announce or implement 
any proposal to name a vessel of the Navy until 30 days after the date 
on which the Secretary submits to the Committees on Armed Services of 
the Senate and the House of Representatives a report setting forth such 
proposal.
    ``(2) Each report under this subsection shall describe the 
justification for the proposal covered by such report in accordance 
with the standards referred to in section 1024(a) of the National 
Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013.''.
    (c) Effective Date.--This section and the amendment made by this 
section shall go into effect on the date that is 30 days after the date 
of the enactment of this Act.

the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the

    title 10, United States Code;
        (2) a detailed description of requirements for rewards in

SEC. 1033. REPORT IN THE EVENT OF INSUFFICIENT FUNDING FOR 
MODERNIZATION OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS STOCKPILE.
    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) consistent with Condition 9 of the Resolution of Advice and 
    Consent to Ratification of the New START Treaty of the Senate, 
    agreed to on December 22, 2010, the United States is committed to 
    ensuring the safety, security, reliability, and credibility of its 
    nuclear forces; and
        (2) the United States is committed to--
            (A) proceeding with a robust stockpile stewardship program 
        and maintaining and modernizing nuclear weapons production 
        capabilities and capacities of the United States to ensure the 
        safety, security, reliability, and credibility of the nuclear 
        arsenal of the United States at the New START Treaty levels and 
        meeting requirements for hedging against possible international 
        developments or technical problems;
            (B) reinvigorating and sustaining the nuclear security 
        laboratories of the United States and preserving the core 
        nuclear weapons competencies therein; and
            (C) providing the resources needed to achieve these 
        objectives, using as a starting point the levels set forth in 
        the President's 10-year plan provided to Congress in November 
        2010 pursuant to section 1251 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 
        Stat. 2549).

        read as follows:
        ``(2) Insufficient funding.--
            ``(A) Report.--During each year in which the New START 
        Treaty is in force, if the President determines that an 
        appropriations Act is enacted that fails to meet the resource 
        levels set forth in the November 2010 update to the plan 
        referred to in section 1251 of the National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 (Public Law 111-84; 123 
        Stat. 2549) or if at any time determines that more resources 
        are required to carry out such plan than were estimated, the 
        President shall transmit to the appropriate congressional 
        committees, within 60 days of making such a determination, a 
        report detailing--

    and inactive stockpiles of the United States by a number that is 
    greater than a de minimis reduction, the President shall certify in 
    writing to the congressional defense committees whether such

    stockpiles to be fewer than the high-confidence assessment of the 
    intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) of the National 
    Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4))) with respect to the

SEC. 1037. NONSTRATEGIC NUCLEAR WEAPON REDUCTIONS AND EXTENDED 
DETERRENCE POLICY.
    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the United States should pursue negotiations with the 
    Russian Federation aimed at the reduction of Russian deployed and 
    nondeployed nonstrategic nuclear forces;
        (2) nonstrategic nuclear weapons should be considered when 
    weighing the balance of the nuclear forces of the United States and 
    the Russian Federation;
        (3) any geographical relocation or storage of nonstrategic 
    nuclear weapons by the Russian Federation does not constitute a 
    reduction or elimination of such weapons;
        (4) the vast advantage of the Russian Federation in 
    nonstrategic nuclear weapons constitutes a threat to the United 
    States and its allies and a growing asymmetry in Western Europe;
        (5) the forward-deployed nuclear forces of the United States 
    are an important contributor to the assurance of the allies of the 
    United States and constitute a check on proliferation and a tool in 
    dealing with neighboring states hostile to the North Atlantic 
    Treaty Organization (``NATO'');
        (6) the United States should maintain its commitment to 
    extended deterrence, specifically the nuclear alliance of NATO, as 
    an important component of ensuring and linking the national 
    security interests of the United States and the security of its 
    European allies;
        (7) forward-deployed nuclear forces of the United States shall 
    remain based in Europe in support of the nuclear policy and posture 
    of NATO subject to the policy and requirements of NATO;
        (8) the presence of nuclear weapons of the United States in 
    Europe--combined with NATO's unique nuclear sharing arrangements 
    under which non-nuclear members participate in nuclear planning and 
    possess specially configured aircraft capable of delivering nuclear 
    weapons--provides reassurance to allies and partners who feel 
    exposed to regional threats; and
        (9) only the President and Congress have the legal authority 
    over the nuclear forces of the United States and no multilateral 
    organization, not even NATO, can articulate a declaratory policy 
    concerning the use of nuclear weapons that binds the United States.
    (b) Notification.--
        (1) In general.--Chapter 24 of title 10, United States Code, as 
    added by section 1031(b), is amended by inserting after section

    humanitarian disasters and the outbreak of hostilities anywhere in 
    the world truly defines the United States as a global power.

    purpose: to answer the call of others so they may prevail.

    in the Nation's defense; and

SEC. 1080. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURES OF 
CLASSIFIED INFORMATION.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) unauthorized disclosures of classified information can 
    threaten the national security and foreign relations of the United 
    States;
        (2) the Department of Defense has taken positive steps toward 
    improving its policies, procedures, and enforcement mechanisms 
    regarding unauthorized disclosures of classified information and 
    should continue to improve upon such policies, procedures, and 
    enforcement mechanisms;
        (3) other departments and agencies of the Federal Government 
    should undertake similar efforts, if such departments and agencies 
    have not already done so; and
        (4) the Department of Justice should investigate possible 
    violations of Federal law related to unauthorized disclosures of 
    classified information, including disclosures related to military, 
    intelligence, and operational capabilities of the United States and 
    allies of the United States and, in appropriate cases, individuals 
    responsible for such unauthorized disclosures should be prosecuted 
    to the full extent of the law.

SEC. 1085. SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING SPECTRUM.
    It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the United States mobile communications industry is a 
    significant economic engine;
        (2) while wireless carriers are continually implementing new 
    and more efficient technologies and techniques to maximize their 
    existing spectrum capacity, there is a pressing need for additional 
    spectrum for mobile broadband services;
        (3) as the United States faces the growing demand for spectrum, 
    consideration should be given to both the supply of spectrum for 
    licensed networks and for unlicensed devices;
        (4) while such growing demand can be met in part by 
    reallocating spectrum from existing non-governmental uses, the 
    long-term solution must include reallocation and sharing of Federal 
    Government spectrum for private sector use;
        (5) recognizing the important uses of spectrum by the Federal 
    Government, including for national security, law enforcement, and 
    other critical Federal uses, existing law ensures that Federal 
    operations are not harmed as a result of a reallocation of spectrum 
    for commercial use, including through the establishment of the 
    Spectrum Relocation Fund to reimburse Federal users for the costs 
    of planning and implementing relocation and sharing arrangements 
    and, with respect to spectrum vacated by the Department of Defense, 
    certification under section 1062(b) of the National Defense 
    Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2000 (Public Law 106-65; 113 
    Stat. 768) by the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Commerce, 
    and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff that replacement 
    spectrum provides comparable technical characteristics to restore 
    essential military capability; and
        (6) given the need to determine equitable outcomes for the 
    United States in relation to spectrum use that balance the demand 
    of the private sector for spectrum with national security and other 
    critical Federal missions, all interested parties should be 
    encouraged to continue the collaborative efforts between industry 
    and government stakeholders that have been launched by the National 
    Telecommunications and Information Administration to assess and 
    recommend practical frameworks for the development of relocation, 
    transition, and sharing arrangement and plans for 110 megahertz of 
    Federal spectrum in the 1695-1710 MHz and the 1755-1850 MHz bands.

    (a) Finding and Purpose.--
        (1) Finding.--Congress finds that the national security and

    effective and efficient manner.
        (2) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to increase the 
    efficiency and effectiveness of the Government by fostering greater 
    interagency experience among executive branch personnel on national 
    security and homeland security matters involving more than 1 
    agency.
    (b) Committee on National Security Personnel.--

    National Security Human Capital Strategy providing policies, 
    processes, and procedures for a program for the interagency 
    rotation of personnel among positions within National Security 
    Interagency Communities of Interest.
        (2) The strategy required by paragraph (1) shall, at a

            that are available for rotation under the program; and
                (ii) individual employees who are available to

established pursuant to subsection (c) shall, at a minimum, provide 
that--
        (1) during each of the first 4 fiscal years after the fiscal 
    year in which this Act is enacted--
            (A) the interagency rotation program shall be carried out 
        in at least 2 Interagency Communities of Interest, of which 1 
        shall be an Interagency Community of Interest for emergency 
        management and 1 shall be an Interagency Community of Interest 
        for stabilization and reconstruction; and
            (B) not fewer than 20 employees in the executive branch of 
        the Government shall be assigned to participate in the 
        interagency personnel rotation program;
        (2) an employee's participation in the interagency rotation 
    program shall require the consent of the head of the agency and 
    shall be voluntary on the part of the employee;
        (3) employees selected to perform interagency rotational 
    service are selected in a fully open and competitive manner that is 
    consistent with the merit system principles set forth in paragraphs 
    (1) and (2) of section 2301(b) of title 5, United States Code, 
    unless the Interagency Community of Interest position is otherwise 
    exempt under another provision of law;
        (4) an employee performing service in a position in another 
    agency pursuant to the program established under this section shall 
    be entitled to return, within a reasonable period of time after the 
    end of the period of service, to the position held by the employee, 
    or a corresponding or higher position, in his or her employing 
    agency;
        (5) an employee performing interagency rotational service shall 
    have all the rights that would be available to the employee if the

    than this section from the agency employing the employee to the 
    agency in which the position in which the employee is serving is 
    located; and
        (6) an employee participating in the program shall receive 
    performance evaluations from officials in his or her employing 
    agency that are based on input from the supervisors of the employee 
    during his or her service in the program that are based primarily 
    on the contribution of the employee to the work of the agency in 
    which the employee performed such service, and these performance 
    evaluations shall be provided the same weight in the receipt of 
    promotions and other rewards by the employee from the employing 
    agency as performance evaluations for service in the employing 
    agency.
    (e) Selection of Individuals to Fill Senior Positions.--The head of 
each agency participating in the program established pursuant to

Interest pursuant to such program.
    (f) Interagency Community of Interest Defined.--As used in this 
section, the term ``National Security Interagency Community of 
Interest'' or ``Interagency Community of Interest'' means the positions 
in the executive branch of the Government that, as determined by the 
Committee on National Security Personnel--
        (1) as a group are positions within multiple agencies of the 
    executive branch of the Government; and
        (2) have significant responsibility for the same substantive, 
    functional, or regional subject area related to national security 
    or homeland security that requires integration of the positions and 
    activities in that area across multiple agencies to ensure that the 
    executive branch of the Government operates as a single, cohesive 
    enterprise to maximize mission success and minimize cost.
    (g) Report on Performance Measures.--Not later than the end of the 
2nd fiscal year after the fiscal year in which this Act is enacted, the

    and by national security agencies;

    protection for United States troops in Afghanistan and the 
    procedures for screening, vetting, and monitoring Afghanistan 
    National Security Forces personnel and Afghan Public Protection 
    Force personnel;
        (3) the Department of Defense and the Government of Afghanistan 
    are making efforts to address the threat of such attacks and 
    associated threats, but continued leadership will be required; and
        (4) the North Atlantic Treaty Organization/International

SEC. 1224. SENSE OF CONGRESS COMMENDING THE ENDURING STRATEGIC 
PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND AFGHANISTAN.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) The United States and Afghanistan have been allies in the 
    conflict against al Qaeda and its affiliates for over a decade, 
    with the shared goal of ensuring that Afghanistan is never again a 
    sanctuary for al Qaeda.
        (2) The United States and Afghanistan are committed to the 
    framework agreed to at the North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
    (NATO) Summit in Lisbon in 2010, and reaffirmed at the NATO Summit 
    in Chicago in 2012, for the transition from coalition forces to the 
    Afghan National Security Forces of lead responsibility for security 
    throughout Afghanistan by the end of 2014.
        (3) In June 2011, President Barack Obama said, ``What we can 
    do, and will do, is build a partnership with the Afghan people that 
    endures--one that ensures that we will be able to continue 
    targeting terrorists and supporting a sovereign Afghan 
    government''.
        (4) In November 2011, a traditional loya jirga in Kabul 
    declared that ``strategic cooperation with the United States of 
    America, which is a strategic ally of the people and government of 
    Afghanistan, is considered important in order to ensure political, 
    economic, and military security'' and also stated, ``Signing a 
    strategic cooperation document with the United States conforms with 
    the national interest of Afghanistan and is of significant 
    importance''.
        (5) On May 2, 2012, President Obama and President Hamid Karzai

    working together for the mutual interests--peace and security and 
    in all other areas''.

    sacrifices in support of military and stability operations in 
    Afghanistan that have helped strengthen security in Afghanistan, 
    laid the foundation for transition to a long-term partnership 
    between the United States and a sovereign Afghanistan, and 
    supported the Government and people of Afghanistan as they continue 
    to build their capacity to effectively and justly govern;
        (2) the United States negotiating team for the Enduring 
    Strategic Partnership Agreement, including the United States 
    Embassy personnel in Kabul under the leadership of Ambassador Ryan 
    Crocker, is to be commended for its committed diplomatic efforts;

    be commended for concluding the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
    Agreement;

    and strengthening institutions and governance in Afghanistan;

    agreed at the Tokyo Conference of July 2012, the Bonn Conference of 
    December 2011, the Kabul Conference of July 2011, and other venues 
    to combat corruption, protect the equal rights of all citizens of 
    Afghanistan and enforce the rule of law, hold free and fair 
    elections in 2014, and build inclusive and effective institutions 
    of democratic governance;
        (6) a key national security interest of the United States is to 
    maintain a long-term political, economic, and military relationship 
    with Afghanistan, including a limited presence of United States 
    Armed Forces for the purpose of training, advising, and supporting 
    Afghan National Security Forces and cooperating on shared 
    counterterrorism objectives;
        (7) the negotiation and conclusion of a Bilateral Security 
    Agreement, as called for in the Enduring Strategic Partnership 
    Agreement, will provide a fundamental framework for the long-term 
    security relationship between the United States and Afghanistan;

    foundation for the emergence of a freely elected, open, and 
    democratic political system;

SHIPPING, AND SHIPBUILDING SECTORS OF IRAN.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) Iran's energy, shipping, and shipbuilding sectors and 
    Iran's ports are facilitating the Government of Iran's nuclear 
    proliferation activities by providing revenue to support 
    proliferation activities.
        (2) The United Nations Security Council and the United States 
    Government have expressed concern about the proliferation risks 
    presented by the Iranian nuclear program.
        (3) The Director General of the International Atomic Energy 
    Agency (in this section referred to as the ``IAEA'') has in 
    successive reports (GOV/2012/37 and GOV/2011/65) identified 
    possible military dimensions of Iran's nuclear program.
        (4) The Government of Iran continues to defy the requirements 
    and obligations contained in relevant IAEA Board of Governors and 
    United Nations Security Council resolutions, including by 
    continuing and expanding uranium enrichment activities in Iran, as 
    reported in IAEA Report GOV/2012/37.
        (5) United Nations Security Council Resolution 1929 (2010) 
    recognizes the ``potential connection between Iran's revenues 
    derived from its energy sector and the funding of Iran's 
    proliferation sensitive nuclear activities''.
        (6) The National Iranian Tanker Company is the main carrier for 
    the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps-designated National Iranian 
    Oil Company and a key element in the petroleum supply chain 
    responsible for generating energy revenues that support the illicit 
    nuclear proliferation activities of the Government of Iran.

    results in a decision not to prosecute, the Inspector General shall 
    promptly determine whether to resume any investigation that was 
    suspended pursuant to this paragraph. In the event that an 
    Inspector General does not resume an investigation, the Inspector 
    General shall document the rationale for the decision.

or cooperative agreement. The report shall include the Inspector 
General's conclusions regarding whether or not any allegations that the 
recipient of a grant, contract, or cooperative agreement; any 
subcontractor or subgrantee of the recipient; or any agent of the 
recipient or of such a subcontractor or subgrantee, engaged in any of

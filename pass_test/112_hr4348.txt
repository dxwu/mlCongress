    (b) Disadvantaged Business Enterprises.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds that--
            (A) while significant progress has occurred due to the 
        establishment of the disadvantaged business enterprise program, 
        discrimination and related barriers continue to pose 
        significant obstacles for minority- and women-owned businesses 
        seeking to do business in federally-assisted surface 
        transportation markets across the United States;
            (B) the continuing barriers described in subparagraph (A) 
        merit the continuation of the disadvantaged business enterprise 
        program;
            (C) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
        documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
        sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
        scientific reports, reports issued by public and private 
        agencies, news stories, reports of discrimination by 
        organizations and individuals, and discrimination lawsuits, 
        which show that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
        insufficient to address the problem;
            (D) the testimony and documentation described in 
        subparagraph (C) demonstrate that discrimination across the 
        United States poses a barrier to full and fair participation in 
        surface transportation-related businesses of women business 
        owners and minority business owners and has impacted firm 
        development and many aspects of surface transportation-related 
        business in the public and private markets; and
            (E) the testimony and documentation described in 
        subparagraph (C) provide a strong basis that there is a 
        compelling need for the continuation of the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program to address race and gender 
        discrimination in surface transportation-related business.
        (2) Definitions.--In this subsection, the following definitions 
    apply:
            (A) Small business concern.--
                (i) In general.--The term ``small business concern'' 
            means a small business concern (as the term is used in 
            section 3 of the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 632)).
                (ii) Exclusions.--The term ``small business concern'' 
            does not include any concern or group of concerns 
            controlled by the same socially and economically 
            disadvantaged individual or individuals that have average 
            annual gross receipts during the preceding 3 fiscal years 
            in excess of $22,410,000, as adjusted annually by the 
            Secretary for inflation.
            (B) Socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.--
        The term ``socially and economically disadvantaged 
        individuals'' has the meaning given the term in section 8(d) of 
        the Small Business Act (15 U.S.C. 637(d)) and relevant 
        subcontracting regulations issued pursuant to that Act, except 
        that women shall be presumed to be socially and economically 
        disadvantaged individuals for purposes of this subsection.
        (3) Amounts for small business concerns.--Except to the extent 
    that the Secretary determines otherwise, not less than 10 percent 
    of the amounts made available for any program under divisions A and 
    B of this Act and section 403 of title 23, United States Code, 
    shall be expended through small business concerns owned and 
    controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
        (4) Annual listing of disadvantaged business enterprises.--Each 
    State shall annually--
            (A) survey and compile a list of the small business 
        concerns referred to in paragraph (2) in the State, including 
        the location of the small business concerns in the State; and
            (B) notify the Secretary, in writing, of the percentage of 
        the small business concerns that are controlled by--
                (i) women;
                (ii) socially and economically disadvantaged 
            individuals (other than women); and
                (iii) individuals who are women and are otherwise 
            socially and economically disadvantaged individuals.
        (5) Uniform certification.--
            (A) In general.--The Secretary shall establish minimum 
        uniform criteria for use by State governments in certifying 
        whether a concern qualifies as a small business concern for the 
        purpose of this subsection.
            (B) Inclusions.--The minimum uniform criteria established 
        under subparagraph (A) shall include, with respect to a 
        potential small business concern--
                (i) on-site visits;
                (ii) personal interviews with personnel;
                (iii) issuance or inspection of licenses;
                (iv) analyses of stock ownership;
                (v) listings of equipment;
                (vi) analyses of bonding capacity;
                (vii) listings of work completed;
                (viii) examination of the resumes of principal owners;
                (ix) analyses of financial capacity; and
                (x) analyses of the type of work preferred.
        (6) Reporting.--The Secretary shall establish minimum 
    requirements for use by State governments in reporting to the 
    Secretary--
            (A) information concerning disadvantaged business 
        enterprise awards, commitments, and achievements; and
            (B) such other information as the Secretary determines to 
        be appropriate for the proper monitoring of the disadvantaged 
        business enterprise program.
        (7) Compliance with court orders.--Nothing in this subsection 
    limits the eligibility of an individual or entity to receive funds 
    made available under divisions A and B of this Act and section 403 
    of title 23, United States Code, if the entity or person is 
    prevented, in whole or in part, from complying with paragraph (2) 
    because a Federal court issues a final order in which the court 
    finds that a requirement or the implementation of paragraph (2) is 
    unconstitutional.

    (c) Distribution of Obligation Authority.--For each of fiscal years

    subsection (a), less the aggregate amounts not distributed under 
    paragraphs (1) and (2) and the amounts distributed under paragraph 
    (4), for Federal-aid highway and highway safety construction

    obligated during that fiscal year; and
        (2) redistribute sufficient amounts to those States able to 
    obligate amounts in addition to those previously distributed during 
    that fiscal year, giving priority to those States having large 
    unobligated balances of funds apportioned under sections 144 (as in 
    effect on the day before the date of enactment of this Act) and 104 
    of title 23, United States Code.
    (e) Applicability of Obligation Limitations to Transportation 
Research Programs.--
        (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2),

        (1) the Secretary and other Federal agencies with relevant 
    jurisdiction in the environmental review process should cooperate 
    with each other and other agencies on environmental review and 
    project delivery activities at the earliest practicable time to 
    avoid delays and duplication of effort later in the process, head 
    off potential conflicts, and ensure that planning and project 
    development decisions reflect environmental values; and
        (2) such cooperation should include the development of policies 
    and the designation of staff that advise planning agencies or 
    project sponsors of studies or other information foreseeably 
    required for later Federal action and early consultation with 
    appropriate State and local agencies and Indian tribes.
    (b) Technical Assistance.--If requested at any time by a State or 
local planning agency, the Secretary and other Federal agencies with 
relevant jurisdiction in the environmental review process, shall, to 
the extent practicable and appropriate, as determined by the agencies, 
provide technical assistance to the State or local planning agency on 
accomplishing the early coordination activities described in subsection 
(d).
    (c) Memorandum of Agency Agreement.--If requested at any time by a 
State or local planning agency, the lead agency, in consultation with

review process, may establish memoranda of agreement with the project 
sponsor, State, and local governments and other appropriate entities to 
accomplish the early coordination activities described in subsection 
(d).
    (d) Early Coordination Activities.--Early coordination activities 
shall include, to the maximum extent practicable, the following:
        (1) Technical assistance on identifying potential impacts and 
    mitigation issues in an integrated fashion.
        (2) The potential appropriateness of using planning products 
    and decisions in later environmental reviews.
        (3) The identification and elimination from detailed study in 
    the environmental review process of the issues that are not 
    significant or that have been covered by prior environmental 
    reviews.
        (4) The identification of other environmental review and 
    consultation requirements so that the lead and cooperating agencies 
    may prepare, as appropriate, other required analyses and studies 
    concurrently with planning activities.
        (5) The identification by agencies with jurisdiction over any 
    permits related to the project of any and all relevant information 
    that will reasonably be required for the project.
        (6) The reduction of duplication between requirements under the 
    National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321 et seq.) 
    and State and local planning and environmental review requirements, 
    unless the agencies are specifically barred from doing so by 
    applicable law.

funded under title 23, United States Code, the Comptroller General of 
the United States shall--
        (1) review State laws and procedures for conducting 
    environmental reviews with regard to such projects and identify the 
    States that have environmental laws that provide environmental 
    protections and opportunities for public involvement that are 
    equivalent to those provided by Federal environmental laws;
        (2) determine the frequency and cost of environmental reviews 
    carried out at the Federal level that are duplicative of State 
    reviews that provide equivalent environmental protections and 
    opportunities for public involvement; and
        (3) not later than 2 years after the date of enactment of this 
    Act, submit to the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure

    contracting approaches, such as design-build or some performance-
    based contracts under which the contractor is paid to assume a 
    certain risk allocation and payment is generally made on a lump-sum 
    basis.

SEC. 1536. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON HARBOR MAINTENANCE.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) there are 926 coastal, Great Lakes, and inland harbors 
    maintained by the Corps of Engineers;
        (2) according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics--
            (A) in 2009, the ports and waterways of the United States 
        handled more than 2,200,000,000 short tons of imports, exports, 
        and domestic shipments; and
            (B) in 2010, United States ports were responsible for more 
        than $1,400,000,000,000 in waterborne imports and exports;
        (3) according to the Congressional Research Service, full 
    channel dimensions are, on average, available approximately \1/3\ 
    of the time at the 59 harbors of the United States with the highest 
    use rates;
        (4) in 1986, Congress created the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund 
    to provide funds for the operation and maintenance of the 
    navigation channels of the United States;
        (5) in fiscal year 2012, the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund is 
    expected to grow from $6,280,000,000 to $7,011,000,000, an increase 
    of approximately 13 percent;
        (6) despite growth of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund, 
    expenditures from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund have not been 
    sufficiently spent; and
        (7) inadequate investment in dredging needs is restricting 
    access to the ports of the United States for domestic shipping, 
    imports, and exports and therefore threatening the economic 
    competitiveness of the United States.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Administration should request full use of the Harbor 
    Maintenance Trust Fund for operating and maintaining the navigation 
    channels of the United States;
        (2) the amounts in the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund should be 
    fully expended to operate and maintain the navigation channels of 
    the United States; and
        (3) Congress should ensure that other programs, projects, and 
    activities of the Civil Works Program of the Corps of Engineers, 
    especially those programs, projects, and activities relating to 
    inland navigation and flood control, are not adversely impacted.
SEC. 1537. ESTIMATE OF HARBOR MAINTENANCE NEEDS.

    expressed as a percentage, of the authorized depth and authorized 
    width of all navigation channels authorized to be maintained using 
    appropriations from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund that would 
    result from harbor maintenance activities to be funded by the 
    budget request; and
        (2) an estimate of the average annual amount of appropriations 
    from the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund that would be required to 
    increase that average availability to 95 percent over a 3-year 
    period.

        public transportation capital projects; and
            (B) develop and implement on a project basis procedures and 
        approaches that--
                (i) address such impediments in a manner similar to the 
            Special Experimental Project Number 15 of the Federal

    to acquire a new bus model and shall not be interpreted as a 
    warranty or guarantee that the new bus model will meet a 
    purchaser's specific requirements.''.

recipient of assistance under this chapter may not deny reasonable 
access for a private intercity or charter transportation operator to 
federally funded public transportation facilities, including intermodal

of assistance and the extent to which access would be detrimental to 
existing public transportation services must be considered.''.

    limits that are in excess of the Federal law and regulations, or to 
    operate under a Federal exemption or grandfather right, in 
    comparison to vehicles that do not operate in excess of Federal law 
    and regulations (other than vehicles with exemptions or grandfather 
    rights);
        (2) evaluate the impacts to the infrastructure in each State 
    that allows a vehicle to operate with size and weight limits that 
    are in excess of the Federal law and regulations, or to operate 
    under a Federal exemption or grandfather right, in comparison to 
    vehicles that do not operate in excess of Federal law and 
    regulations (other than vehicles with exemptions or grandfather 
    rights), including--
            (A) the cost and benefits of the impacts in dollars;
            (B) the percentage of trucks operating in excess of the

        impacts, or the benefits incurred;
        (3) evaluate the frequency of violations in excess of the 
    Federal size and weight law and regulations, the cost of the 
    enforcement of the law and regulations, and the effectiveness of 
    the enforcement methods;
        (4) assess the impacts that vehicles that operate with size and 
    weight limits in excess of the Federal law and regulations, or that 
    operate under a Federal exemption or grandfather right, in 
    comparison to vehicles that do not operate in excess of Federal law 
    and regulations (other than vehicles with exemptions or grandfather 
    rights), have on bridges, including the impacts resulting from the 
    number of bridge loadings;
        (5) compare and contrast the potential safety and 
    infrastructure impacts of the current Federal law and regulations 
    regarding truck size and weight limits in relation to--
            (A) six-axle and other alternative configurations of 
        tractor-trailers; and
            (B) where available, safety records of foreign nations with 
        truck size and weight limits and tractor-trailer configurations 
        that differ from the Federal law and regulations; and
        (6) estimate--
            (A) the extent to which freight would likely be diverted 
        from other surface transportation modes to principal arterial 
        routes and National Highway System intermodal connectors if 
        alternative truck configuration is allowed to operate and the 
        effect that any such diversion would have on other modes of 
        transportation;
            (B) the effect that any such diversion would have on public 
        safety, infrastructure, cost responsibilities, fuel efficiency, 
        freight transportation costs, and the environment;
            (C) the effect on the transportation network of the United 
        States that allowing alternative truck configuration to operate 
        would have; and
            (D) whether allowing alternative truck configuration to 
        operate would result in an increase or decrease in the total 
        number of trucks operating on principal arterial routes and 
        National Highway System intermodal connectors; and
        (7) identify all Federal rules and regulations impacted by 
    changes in truck size and weight limits.
    (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date that the study 
is commenced under subsection (a), the Secretary shall submit a final

        (2) Interim period.--A National Flood Insurance Program rate 
    map in effect on the date of enactment of this Act for an area for 
    which the Administrator has made a determination under paragraph 
    (1) shall continue in effect with respect to the area during the 
    period--
            (A) beginning on the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (B) ending on the date on which the Administrator

SEC. 100230. ELIGIBILITY FOR FLOOD INSURANCE FOR PERSONS RESIDING IN 
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE MADE ADEQUATE PROGRESS ON THE RECONSTRUCTION OR 
IMPROVEMENT OF A FLOOD PROTECTION SYSTEM.
    (a) Eligibility for Flood Insurance Coverage.--
        (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of law 
    (including section 1307(e) of the National Flood Insurance Act of 
    1968 (42 U.S.C. 4014(e))), a person residing in a community that 
    the Administrator determines has made adequate progress on the 
    reconstruction or improvement of a flood protection system that 
    will afford flood protection for a 100-year floodplain (without 
    regard to the level of Federal funding of or participation in the 
    construction, reconstruction, or improvement), shall be eligible 
    for flood insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance 
    Program--
            (A) if the person resides in a community that is a 
        participant in the National Flood Insurance Program; and
            (B) at a risk premium rate that does not exceed the risk 
        premium rate that would be chargeable if the flood protection 
        system had been completed.
        (2) Adequate progress.--
            (A) Reconstruction or improvement.--For purposes of 
        paragraph (1), the Administrator shall determine that a 
        community has made adequate progress on the reconstruction or 
        improvement of a flood protection system if--
                (i) 100 percent of the project cost has been 
            authorized;
                (ii) not less than 60 percent of the project cost has 
            been secured or appropriated;
                (iii) not less than 50 percent of the flood protection 
            system has been assessed as being without deficiencies; and
                (iv) the reconstruction or improvement has a project 
            schedule that does not exceed 5 years, beginning on the 
            date on which the reconstruction or construction of the 
            improvement commences.
            (B) Considerations.--In determining whether a flood 
        protection system has been assessed as being without 
        deficiencies, the Administrator shall consider the requirements 
        under section 65.10 of chapter 44, Code of Federal Regulations, 
        or any successor thereto.
            (C) Date of commencement.--For purposes of subparagraph 
        (A)(iv) of this paragraph and subsection (b)(2)(B), the date of 
        commencement of the reconstruction or improvement of a flood 
        protection system that is undergoing reconstruction or 
        improvement on the date of enactment of this Act shall be 
        deemed to be the date on which the owner of the flood 
        protection system submits a request under paragraph (3).
        (3) Request for determination.--The owner of a flood protection 
    system that is undergoing reconstruction or improvement on the date 
    of enactment of this Act may submit to the Administrator a request 
    for a determination under paragraph (2) that the community in which 
    the flood protection system is located has made adequate progress 
    on the reconstruction or improvement of the flood protection 
    system.
        (4) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this subsection shall be 
    construed to prohibit the Administrator from making a determination 
    under paragraph (2) for any community in which a flood protection 
    system is not undergoing reconstruction or improvement on the date 
    of enactment of this Act.
    (b) Termination of Eligibility.--
        (1) Adequate continuing progress.--The Administrator shall 
    issue rules to establish a method of determining whether a 
    community has made adequate continuing progress on the 
    reconstruction or improvement of a flood protection system that 
    includes--
            (A) a requirement that the Administrator shall--
                (i) consult with the owner of the flood protection 
            system--

                    (I) 6 months after the date of a determination 
                under subsection (a);
                    (II) 18 months after the date of a determination 
                under subsection (a); and
                    (III) 36 months after the date of a determination 
                under subsection (a); and

                (ii) after each consultation under clause (i), 
            determine whether the reconstruction or improvement is 
            reasonably likely to be completed in accordance with the 
            project schedule described in subsection (a)(2)(A)(iv); and
            (B) a requirement that, if the Administrator makes a 
        determination under subparagraph (A)(ii) that reconstruction or 
        improvement is not reasonably likely to be completed in 
        accordance with the project schedule, the Administrator shall--
                (i) not later than 30 days after the date of the 
            determination, notify the owner of the flood protection 
            system of the determination and provide the rationale and 
            evidence for the determination; and
                (ii) provide the owner of the flood protection system 
            the opportunity to appeal the determination.
        (2) Termination.--The Administrator shall terminate the 
    eligibility for flood insurance coverage under subsection (a) for 
    persons residing in a community with respect to which the 
    Administrator made a determination under subsection (a) if--
            (A) the Administrator determines that the community has not 
        made adequate continuing progress; or
            (B) on the date that is 5 years after the date on which the 
        reconstruction or construction of the improvement commences, 
        the project has not been completed.
        (3) Waiver.--A person whose eligibility would otherwise be 
    terminated under paragraph (2)(B) shall continue to be eligible to 
    purchase flood insurance coverage described in subsection (a) if 
    the Administrator determines--
            (A) the community has made adequate continuing progress on 
        the reconstruction or improvement of a flood protection system; 
        and
            (B) there is a reasonable expectation that the 
        reconstruction or improvement of the flood protection system 
        will be completed not later than 1 year after the date of the 
        determination under this paragraph.
        (4) Risk premium rate.--If the Administrator terminates the 
    eligibility of persons residing in a community to purchase flood 
    insurance coverage described in subsection (a), the Administrator 
    shall establish an appropriate risk premium rate for flood 
    insurance coverage under the National Flood Insurance Program for 
    persons residing in the community that purchased flood insurance 
    coverage before the date on which the termination of eligibility 
    takes effect, taking into consideration the then-current state of 
    the flood protection system.
    (c) Additional Authority.--
        (1) Additional authority.--Notwithstanding subsection (a), in 
    exceptional and exigent circumstances, the Administrator may, in 
    the Administrator's sole discretion, determine that a person 
    residing in a community, which is a participant in the National 
    Flood Insurance Program, that has begun reconstruction or 
    improvement of a flood protection system that will afford flood 
    protection for a 100-year floodplain (without regard to the level 
    of Federal funding of or participation in the reconstruction or 
    improvement) shall be eligible for flood insurance coverage under 
    the National Flood Insurance Program at a risk premium rate that 
    does not exceed the risk premium rate that would be chargeable if 
    the flood protection system had been completed, provided--
            (A) the community makes a written request for the 
        determination setting forth the exceptional and exigent 
        circumstances, including why the community cannot meet the 
        criteria for adequate progress set forth in under subsection 
        (a)(2)(A) and why immediate relief is necessary;
            (B) the Administrator submits a written report setting 
        forth findings of the exceptional and exigent circumstances on 
        which the Administrator based an affirmative determination to 
        the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs of the 
        Senate, and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
        Representatives not later than 15 days before making the 
        determination; and
            (C) the eligibility for flood insurance coverage at a risk 
        premium rate determined under this subsection terminates no 
        later than 1 year after the date on which the Administrator 
        makes the determination.
        (2) Limitation.--Upon termination of eligibility under 
    paragraph (1)(C), a community may submit another request pursuant 
    to paragraph (1)(A). The Administrator may make no more than two 
    determinations under paragraph (1) with respect to persons residing 
    within any single requesting community.
        (3) Termination.--The authority provided under paragraphs (1) 
    and (2) shall terminate two years after the enactment of this Act.
SEC. 100231. STUDIES AND REPORTS.
    (a) Report on Improving the National Flood Insurance Program.--Not 
later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this Act, the 
Comptroller General of the United States shall conduct a study and 
submit a report to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs 
of the Senate and the Committee on Financial Services of the House of 
Representatives, on--
        (1) the number of flood insurance policy holders currently 
    insuring--
            (A) a residential structure up to the maximum available 
        coverage amount, as established in section 61.6 of title 44, 
        Code of Federal Regulations, of--
                (i) $250,000 for the structure; and
                (ii) $100,000 for the contents of such structure; or
            (B) a commercial structure up to the maximum available 
        coverage amount, as established in section 61.6 of title 44, 
        Code of Federal Regulations, of $500,000;
        (2) the increased losses the National Flood Insurance Program 
    would have sustained during the 2004 and 2005 hurricane season if 
    the National Flood Insurance Program had insured all policyholders 
    up to the maximum conforming loan limit for fiscal year 2006 of 
    $417,000, as established under section 302(b)(2) of the Federal 
    National Mortgage Association Charter Act (12 U.S.C. 1717(b)(2));
        (3) the availability in the private marketplace of flood 
    insurance coverage in amounts that exceed the current limits of 
    coverage amounts established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of

            (A) raising the current limits of coverage amounts 
        established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, would have on the ability of private insurers to 
        continue providing flood insurance coverage; and
            (B) reducing the current limits of coverage amounts 
        established in section 61.6 of title 44, Code of Federal 
        Regulations, would have on the ability of private insurers to 
        provide sufficient flood insurance coverage to effectively 
        replace the current level of flood insurance coverage being 
        provided under the National Flood Insurance Program.

        (1) Study.--
            (A) Study required.--The Administrator shall enter into a 
        contract under which the National Academy of Sciences shall 
        conduct a study exploring methods for understanding graduated 
        risk behind levees and the associated land development, 
        insurance, and risk communication dimensions.
            (B) Contents of study.--The study under this paragraph 
        shall--
                (i) research, review, and recommend current best 
            practices for estimating direct annualized flood losses 
            behind levees for residential and commercial structures;
                (ii) rank each best practice recommended under clause 
            (i) based on the best value, balancing cost, scientific 
            integrity, and the inherent uncertainties associated with 
            all aspects of the loss estimate, including geotechnical 
            engineering, flood frequency estimates, economic value, and 
            direct damages;
                (iii) research, review, and identify current best 
            floodplain management and land use practices behind levees

            environmental considerations as part of an overall flood 
            risk management strategy;
                (iv) identify areas in which the best floodplain 
            management and land use practices described in clause (iii) 
            have proven effective and recommend methods and processes 
            by which such practices could be applied more broadly 
            across the United States, given the variety of different 
            flood risks, State and local legal frameworks, and evolving 
            judicial opinions;
                (v) research, review, and identify a variety of flood 
            insurance pricing options for flood hazards behind levees 
            that are actuarially sound and based on the flood risk data 
            developed using the 3 best practices recommended under 
            clause (i) that have the best value as determined under 
            clause (ii);
                (vi) evaluate and recommend methods to reduce insurance 
            costs through creative arrangements between insureds and 
            insurers while keeping a clear accounting of how much 
            financial risk is being borne by various parties such that 
            the entire risk is accounted for, including establishment 
            of explicit limits on disaster aid or other assistance in 
            the event of a flood; and
                (vii) taking into consideration the recommendations 
            under clauses (i) through (iii), recommend approaches to 
            communicate the associated risks to community officials, 
            homeowners, and other residents of communities.
        (2) Report.--The contract under paragraph (1)(A) shall provide 
    that not later than 12 months after the date of enactment of this

            (B) certifies to the Administrator and the Chief of 
        Engineers that the community will continue to participate in 
        the National Flood Insurance Program.
    (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other prohibition on

        (1) the Administrator and the Chief of Engineers make a 
    determination that--
            (A) construction of the proposed permanent flood risk

        flooding risk than an open floodplain or other flood risk 
        reduction measures;

        complies with Federal, State, and local requirements, including 
        mitigation of adverse impacts and implementation of floodplain 
        management requirements, which shall include an evaluation of 
        whether the construction, operation, and maintenance of the 
        proposed levee--

            standards and practices;
                (ii) would be the most cost-effective measure to 
            protect against the assessed flood risk; and

            (C) the State, local, or tribal government seeking to 
        construct the proposed permanent flood risk reduction levee has 
        provided an adequate maintenance plan that documents the 
        procedures the State, local, or tribal government will use to 
        ensure that the stability, height, and overall integrity of the 
        proposed levee and the structure and systems of the proposed 
        levee are maintained, including--
                (i) specifying the maintenance activities to be 
            performed;

                (v) documenting the ability of the State, local, or 
            tribal government to finance the maintenance of the levee; 
            and
        (2) before the commencement of construction, the State, local, 
    or tribal government provides to the Administrator an amount--
            (A) equal to the Federal share of all project costs 
        previously provided by the Administrator under the applicable 
        program for each deed restricted parcel of the covered hazard 
        mitigation land, which the Administrator shall deposit in the 
        National Flood Insurance Fund; and
            (B) that does not include any Federal funds.
    (c) Maintenance Certification.--
        (1) In general.--A State, local, or tribal government that 
    constructs a permanent flood risk reduction levee under subsection 
    (b) shall submit to the Administrator and the Chief of Engineers an 
    annual certification indicating whether the State, local, or tribal 
    government is in compliance with the maintenance plan provided 
    under subsection (b)(1)(C).

        (4) the current financial condition of State residual markets 
    and catastrophe funds in high-risk regions, including the 
    likelihood of insolvency following a natural catastrophe, the

            (D) 631 East Main Cross Street, Findlay, Ohio, 45840; and
        (3) is located in a community that--
            (A) is participating in the National Flood Insurance 
        Program on the date on which a State, local, or tribal 
        government submits an application requesting to construct a 
        flood protection improvement under subsection (b); and
            (B) certifies to the Administrator and the Chief of 
        Engineers that the community will continue to participate in 
        the National Flood Insurance Program.
    (b) Authority.--Notwithstanding any other prohibition on 
construction on property acquired with funding from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for conversion to open space purposes, the 
Administrator shall allow the construction of a flood protection 
improvement by a State, local, or tribal government on covered hazard 
mitigation land if--
        (1) the Administrator and the Chief of Engineers make a 
    determination that--
            (A) construction of the proposed flood protection 
        improvement would more effectively mitigate against flooding 
        risk than an open floodplain or other flood risk reduction 
        measures;
            (B) the proposed flood protection improvement complies with 
        Federal, State, and local requirements, including mitigation of 
        adverse impacts and implementation of floodplain management 
        requirements, which shall include an evaluation of whether the 
        construction, operation, and maintenance of the proposed flood 
        protection improvement--
                (i) would continue to meet best available industry 
            standards and practices;
                (ii) would be the most cost-effective measure to

                                 AN ACT


 
   To provide for the establishment of the Special Envoy to Promote 
 Religious Freedom of Religious Minorities in the Near East and South 
                             Central Asia.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) Seven Baha'i leaders in Iran have been wrongfully 
        imprisoned since 2008.
            (2) In May 2010, suspected terrorists attacked two mosques 
        in Pakistan belonging to the Ahmaddiya minority Muslim sect, 
        killing at least 80 people. Ahmadis consider themselves Muslim, 
        but Pakistani law does not recognize them as such.
            (3) Said Musa, an Afghan Christian convert, was arrested in 
        May 2010 on charges of apostasy, a crime which can carry the 
        death sentence, and was released in February 2011 only after 
        sustained international pressure.
            (4) On October 31, 2010, gunmen laid siege on Our Lady of 
        Salvation Church in Baghdad, Iraq killing at least 52 police 
        and worshipers, including two priests, making it the worst 
        massacre of Iraqi Christians since 2003.
            (5) Iraq's ancient and once vibrant Christian population 
        that numbered an estimated 1,500,000 out of a total population 
        in Iraq of 30,000,000 in 2003 has been reduced by at least one 
        half, due in significant part to Christians fleeing the 
        violence.
            (6) In November 2010, a Pakistani court sentenced Aasia 
        Bibi, a Christian mother of five, to death under the country's 
        blashphemy law for insulting the Prophet Muhammad.
            (7) On New Year's Eve 2010, 23 people were killed when a 
        suicide bomber attacked a Coptic Christian church in 
        Alexandria, Egypt.
            (8) On March 2, 2011, Pakistani Federal Minorities Minister 
        Shahbaz Bhatti, the only Christian member of the Cabinet, who 
        was outspoken in his opposition to Pakistan's blasphemy laws 
        was assassinated by extremists.
            (9) The Department of State's 2010 International Religious 
        Freedom Report stated that many religious minority groups in 
        Uzbekistan ``faced heavy fines and/or short jail terms for 
        violations of restrictive religion laws''.
            (10) The Special Envoy for Anti-Semitism, Hannah Rosenthal, 
        has noted that Holocaust glorification ``is especially virulent 
        in the Middle East media''.
            (11) A number of countries in the Middle East have recently 
        undergone popular revolutions which in some countries have left 
        security vacuums making religious minorities especially 
        vulnerable to violent attacks, such as--
                    (A) in March 2011, the Shahedin Church in Helwan 
                province, Egypt, was torched, leading to protests which 
                spurred sectarian clashes in the streets of Cairo;
                    (B) on March 20, 2011, a group of Salafists in 
                Upper Egypt cut off a Christian man's ear and burned 
                his home and car; and
                    (C) news reports from April 2011 indicate that 
                Salafi organizations in Egypt have been implicated in 
                the destruction of Sufi shrines across the country 
                fueling violent conflict.
            (12) Many of these ancient faith communities are being 
        forced to flee the lands which they have inhabited for 
        centuries.
            (13) The United States Commission on International 
        Religious Freedom has recommended that Iran, Iraq, Pakistan, 
        Saudi Arabia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan be designated by the 
        Department of State as Countries of Particular Concern in 
        accordance with the International Religious Freedom Act of 
        1998.
            (14) The situation on the ground in the region continues to 
        develop rapidly and the United States Government needs an 
        individual who can respond in kind and focus on the critical 
        situation of religious minorities in these countries.

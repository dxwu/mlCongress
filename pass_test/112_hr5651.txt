    (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
            (1) Findings.--The Congress finds as follows:
                    (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to 
                in this subsection as the ``FDA'') serves a critical 
                role in helping to assure that new medicines are safe 
                and effective. Regulatory innovation is 1 element of 
                the Nation's strategy to address serious and life-
                threatening diseases or conditions by promoting 
                investment in and development of innovative treatments 
                for unmet medical needs.
                    (B) During the 2 decades following the 
                establishment of the accelerated approval mechanism, 
                advances in medical sciences, including genomics, 
                molecular biology, and bioinformatics, have provided an 
                unprecedented understanding of the underlying 
                biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. A new 
                generation of modern, targeted medicines is under 
                development to treat serious and life-threatening 
                diseases, some applying drug development strategies 
                based on biomarkers or pharmacogenomics, predictive 
                toxicology, clinical trial enrichment techniques, and 
                novel clinical trial designs, such as adaptive clinical 
                trials.
                    (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and 
                medical advances, the FDA should be encouraged to 
                implement more broadly effective processes for the 
                expedited development and review of innovative new 
                medicines intended to address unmet medical needs for 
                serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions, 
                including those for rare diseases or conditions, using 
                a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and 
                modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development 
                cycle when appropriate. This may result in fewer, 
                smaller, or shorter clinical trials for the intended 
                patient population or targeted subpopulation without 
                compromising or altering the high standards of the FDA 
                for the approval of drugs.
                    (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe 
                and effective innovative therapies to treat unmet 
                medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases 
                or conditions.
                    (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in 
                effect on the day before the date of enactment of this 
                Act governing expedited approval of drugs for serious 
                or life-threatening diseases or conditions should be 
                amended in order to enhance the authority of the FDA to 
                consider appropriate scientific data, methods, and 
                tools, and to expedite development and access to novel 
                treatments for patients with a broad range of serious 
                or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of the Congress 
        that the FDA should apply the accelerated approval and fast 
        track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal Food, 
        Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as amended by this 
        section, to help expedite the development and availability to 
        patients of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases 
        or conditions while maintaining safety and effectiveness 
        standards for such treatments.
    (b) Expedited Approval.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. 356) is amended to 
read as follows:

``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-THREATENING 
              DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.

    ``(a) Designation of Drug as a Fast Track Product.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of 
        the sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and 
        expedite the review of such drug if it is intended, whether 
        alone or in combination with one or more other drugs, for the 
        treatment of a serious or life-threatening disease or 
        condition, and it demonstrates the potential to address unmet 
        medical needs for such a disease or condition. In this section, 
        such a drug is referred to as a `fast track product'.
            ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug 
        may request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track 
        product. A request for the designation may be made concurrently 
        with, or at any time after, submission of an application for 
        the investigation of the drug under section 505(i) of this Act 
        or section 351(a)(3) of the Public Health Service Act.
            ``(3) Designation.--Within 60 calendar days after the 
        receipt of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall 
        determine whether the drug that is the subject of the request 
        meets the criteria described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary 
        finds that the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall 
        designate the drug as a fast track product and shall take such 
        actions as are appropriate to expedite the development and 
        review of the application for approval of such product.
    ``(b) Accelerated Approval of a Drug for a Serious or Life-
Threatening Disease or Condition, Including a Fast Track Product.--
            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary may approve an application 
        for approval of a product for a serious or life-threatening 
        disease or condition, including a fast track product, under 
        section 505(c) of this Act or section 351(a) of the Public 
        Health Service Act upon making a determination that the product 
        has an effect on--
                    ``(A) a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably 
                likely to predict clinical benefit; or
                    ``(B) a clinical endpoint that can be measured 
                earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that 
                is reasonably likely to predict an effect on 
                irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical 
                benefit,
        taking into account the severity or rarity of the disease or 
        condition and the availability of alternative treatments. The 
        evidence to support that an endpoint is reasonably likely to 
        predict clinical benefit may include epidemiological, 
        pathophysiologic, pharmacologic, therapeutic or other evidence 
        developed using, for example, biomarkers, or other scientific 
        methods or tools.
            ``(2) Limitation.--Approval of a product under this 
        subsection may, as determined by the Secretary, be subject to 
        the following requirements--
                    ``(A) that the sponsor conduct appropriate post-
                approval studies to verify and describe the predicted 
                effect of the product on irreversible morbidity or 
                mortality or other clinical benefit; and
                    ``(B) that the sponsor submit copies of all 
                promotional materials related to the product, at least 
                30 days prior to dissemination of the materials--
                            ``(i) during the preapproval review period; 
                        and
                            ``(ii) following approval, for a period 
                        that the Secretary determines to be 
                        appropriate.
            ``(3) Expedited withdrawal of approval.--The Secretary may 
        withdraw approval of a product approved pursuant to this 
        subsection using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the 
        Secretary in regulations, which shall include an opportunity 
        for an informal hearing) if--
                    ``(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required 
                post-approval study of the product with due diligence;

                predicted effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality 
                or other clinical benefit of the product fails to 
                verify and describe such effect or benefit;

                is not safe or effective under the conditions of use; 
                or
                    ``(D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading 
                promotional materials with respect to the product.
    ``(c) Review of Incomplete Applications for Approval of a Fast 
Track Product.--
            ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary determines, after 
        preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the 
        sponsor, that a fast track product may be effective, the 
        Secretary shall evaluate for filing, and may commence review of 
        portions of, an application for the approval of the product 
        before the sponsor submits a complete application. The 
        Secretary shall commence such review only if the applicant--
                    ``(A) provides a schedule for submission of 
                information necessary to make the application complete; 
                and

                section 736.
            ``(2) Exception.--Any time period for review of human drug 
        applications that has been agreed to by the Secretary and that 
        has been set forth in goals identified in letters of the 
        Secretary (relating to the use of fees collected under section 
        736 to expedite the drug development process and the review of 
        human drug applications) shall not apply to an application 
        submitted under paragraph (1) until the date on which the 
        application is complete.
    ``(d) Awareness Efforts.--The Secretary shall--
            ``(1) develop and disseminate to physicians, patient 
        organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and 
        other appropriate persons a description of the provisions of 
        this section applicable to accelerated approval and fast track 
        products; and
            ``(2) establish a program to encourage the development of 
        surrogate and clinical endpoints, including biomarkers, and 
        other scientific methods and tools that can assist the 
        Secretary in determining whether the evidence submitted in an 
        application is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit 
        for serious or life-threatening conditions for which there 
        exist significant unmet medical needs.''.

SEC. 842. GUIDANCE; AMENDED REGULATIONS.

    (a) Initial Guidance.--Not later than one year after the date of 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services (in 
this subtitle referred to as the ``Secretary'') shall issue draft 
guidance to implement the amendment made by section 841.
    (b) Final Guidance.--Not later than one year after the issuance of 
draft guidance under subsection (a), after an opportunity for public 
comment, the Secretary shall--

        section 841; and
            (2) amend the regulations governing accelerated approval in 
        parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as 
        necessary to conform such regulations with the amendments made 
        by section 841.
    (c) Considerations.--In developing the guidance under subsections 
(a) and (b)(1) and the amendments under subsection (b)(2), the 
Secretary shall consider--
            (1) issues arising under the accelerated approval and fast 
        track processes under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, 
        and Cosmetic Act (as amended by section 841) for drugs 
        designated for a rare disease or condition under section 526 of 
        the Federal, Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; and
            (2) how to incorporate novel approaches to the review of 
        surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and pharmacologic 
        evidence in such guidance, especially in instances where the 
        low prevalence of a disease renders the existence or collection 
        of other types of data unlikely or impractical.
    (d) No Delay in Review or Approval.--The issuance (or non-issuance) 
of guidance or conforming regulations implementing the amendments made 
by section 841 shall not preclude the review of, or action on, a

    Subchapter E of chapter V (21 U.S.C. 360bbb et seq.), as amended by 
section 811(b), is further amended by adding at the end the following:

``SEC. 569. CONSULTATION WITH EXTERNAL EXPERTS ON RARE DISEASES, 
              TARGETED THERAPIES, AND GENETIC TARGETING OF TREATMENTS.

    ``(a) In General.--For the purpose of promoting the efficiency of 
and informing the review by the Food and Drug Administration of new 
drugs and biological products for rare diseases and drugs and 
biological products that are genetically targeted, the following shall 
apply:
            ``(1) Consultation with stakeholders.--Consistent with 
        sections X.C and IX.E.4 of the PDUFA Reauthorization 
        Performance Goals and Procedures Fiscal Years 2013 through 
        2017, as referenced in the letters described in section 101(b) 
        of the Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2012, the

        stakeholders on the topics described in subsection (b).

                their special expertise, are qualified to provide 
                advice on rare disease issues, including topics 
                described in subsection (c). The Secretary may, when 
                appropriate to address a specific regulatory question, 
                consult such external experts on issues related to the 
                review of new drugs and biological products for rare 
                diseases and drugs and biological products that are 
                genetically targeted, including the topics described in 
                subsection (b), when such consultation is necessary 
                because the Secretary lacks the specific scientific, 
                medical, or technical expertise necessary for the 
                performance of the Secretary's regulatory 
                responsibilities and the necessary expertise can be 
                provided by the external experts.
                    ``(B) External experts.--For purposes of 
                subparagraph (A), external experts are individuals who 
                possess scientific or medical training that the 
                Secretary lacks with respect to one or more rare 
                diseases.
    ``(b) Topics for Consultation.--Topics for consultation pursuant to 
this section may include--
            ``(1) rare diseases;
            ``(2) the severity of rare diseases;
            ``(3) the unmet medical need associated with rare diseases;
            ``(4) the willingness and ability of individuals with a 
        rare disease to participate in clinical trials;
            ``(5) an assessment of the benefits and risks of therapies 
        to treat rare diseases;
            ``(6) the general design of clinical trials for rare 
        disease populations and subpopulations; and
            ``(7) the demographics and the clinical description of 
        patient populations.
    ``(c) Classification as Special Government Employees.--The external 
experts who are consulted under this section may be considered special 
government employees, as defined under section 202 of title 18, United 
States Code.
    ``(d) Protection of Confidential Information and Trade Secrets.--
            ``(1) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this section shall 
        be construed to alter the protections offered by laws, 
        regulations, and policies governing disclosure of confidential 
        commercial or trade secret information, and any other 
        information exempt from disclosure pursuant to section 552(b) 
        of title 5, United States Code, as such provisions would be 
        applied to consultation with individuals and organizations 
        prior to the date of enactment of this section.

        not disclose confidential commercial or trade secret 
        information to an expert consulted under this section without 
        the written consent of the sponsor unless the expert is a 
        special government employee (as defined under section 202 of 
        title 18, United States Code) or the disclosure is otherwise 
        authorized by law.

construed to limit the ability of the Secretary to consult with 
individuals and organizations as authorized prior to the date of 
enactment of this section.

        particular expert or stakeholder.

        this section is intended to increase the number of review 
        cycles as in effect before the date of enactment of this

external expert, as described in this section, relating to an 
investigational new drug application under section 505(i), a new drug 
application under section 505(b), or a biologics license application 
under section 351 of the Public Health Service Act, the Director of the 
Center for Drug Evaluation and Research or the Director of the Center 
for Biologics Evaluation and Research (or appropriate Division 
Director), as appropriate, shall determine that--

                complete the Secretary's review;

            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of 
        the sponsor of a drug, expedite the development and review of 
        such drug if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with 
        1 or more other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening 
        disease or condition and preliminary clinical evidence 
        indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement 
        over existing therapies on 1 or more clinically significant 
        endpoints, such as substantial treatment effects observed early 
        in clinical development. In this section, such a drug is

                paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that the drug 
                meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the 
                drug as a breakthrough therapy and shall take such 
                actions as are appropriate to expedite the development

                drug, but not to include a change in production due to 
                matters such as routine maintenance or insignificant

SEC. 905. STUDY ON DRUG SHORTAGES.

    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study to examine the cause of drug shortages and formulate 
recommendations on how to prevent or alleviate such shortages.
    (b) Consideration.--In conducting the study under this section, the 
Comptroller General shall consider the following questions:
            (1) What are the dominant characteristics of drugs that 
        have gone into actual shortage over the preceding three years?
            (2) Are there systemic high-risk factors (such as drug 
        pricing structure, including Federal reimbursements, or the 
        number of manufacturers producing a drug product) that have led 
        to the concentration of drug shortages in certain drug products 
        that have made such products vulnerable to drug shortages?
            (3) Is there a reason why drug shortages have occurred 
        primarily in the sterile injectable market and in certain 
        therapeutic areas?
            (4) How have regulations, guidance documents, regulatory 
        practices, and other actions of Federal departments and 
        agencies (including the effectiveness of interagency and 
        intraagency coordination, communication, strategic planning, 
        and decision-making) affected drug shortages?
            (5) How does hoarding affect drug shortages?
            (6) How would incentives alleviate or prevent drug 
        shortages?
            (7) How are healthcare providers, including hospitals and 
        physicians responding to drug shortages, to what extent are 
        such providers able to adjust care effectively to compensate 
        for such shortages, and what impediments exist that hinder 
        provider ability to adjust to such shortages?
    (c) Consultation With Stakeholders.--In conducting the study under 
this section, the Comptroller General shall consult with relevant 
stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, patients, 
drug manufacturers, and other health providers.
    (d) Report.--Note later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the 
Senate on the results of the study under this section.

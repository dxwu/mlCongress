    opportunity to emigrate, free of any heavy tax on emigration or on 
    the visas or other documents required for emigration and free of

        (4) On December 16, 2011, the Ministerial Conference of the

            (A) In general.--If, in preparing a report required by

        Russian Federation is not fully implementing an agreement 
        specified in subparagraph (A) or (B) of that paragraph or that 
        the Russian Federation is not making adequate progress in

        Federation or requests assistance pursuant to paragraph (1).
    SEC. 203. REPORTS ON LAWS, POLICIES, AND PRACTICES OF THE RUSSIAN 
      FEDERATION THAT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST UNITED STATES DIGITAL TRADE.
    Section 181(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2241(a)) is

        TITLE III--PERMANENT NORMAL TRADE RELATIONS FOR MOLDOVA

    SEC. 301. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) Moldova allows its citizens the right and opportunity to 
    emigrate, free of any heavy tax on emigration or on the visas or 
    other documents required for emigration and free of any tax, levy, 
    fine, fee, or other charge on any citizens as a consequence of the 
    desire of those citizens to emigrate to the country of their 
    choice.
        (2) Moldova has been found to be in full compliance with the 
    freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act 
    of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) since 1997.
        (3) Moldova acceded to the World Trade Organization on July 26, 
    2001.
    SEC. 302. TERMINATION OF APPLICATION OF TITLE IV OF THE TRADE ACT 
      OF 1974 TO PRODUCTS OF MOLDOVA.
    (a) Presidential Determinations and Extension of Nondiscriminatory 
Treatment.--Notwithstanding any provision of title IV of the Trade Act 
of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.), the President may--
        (1) determine that such title should no longer apply to 
    Moldova; and
        (2) after making a determination under paragraph (1) with 
    respect to Moldova, proclaim the extension of nondiscriminatory 
    treatment (normal trade relations treatment) to the products of 
    Moldova.
    (b) Termination of Applicability of Title IV.--On and after the 
date on which the President extends nondiscriminatory treatment to the 
products of Moldova pursuant to subsection (a), title IV of the Trade 
Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431 et seq.) shall cease to apply to Moldova.

   TITLE IV--SERGEI MAGNITSKY RULE OF LAW ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2012

    SEC. 401. SHORT TITLE.
    This title may be cited as the ``Sergei Magnitsky Rule of Law 
Accountability Act of 2012''.
    SEC. 402. FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) The United States aspires to a mutually beneficial 
    relationship with the Russian Federation based on respect for human 
    rights and the rule of law, and supports the people of the Russian 
    Federation in their efforts to realize their full economic 
    potential and to advance democracy, human rights, and the rule of 
    law.
        (2) The Russian Federation--
            (A) is a member of the United Nations, the Organization for 
        Security and Co-operation in Europe, the Council of Europe, and 
        the International Monetary Fund;
            (B) has ratified the Convention against Torture and Other 
        Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, the 
        International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the 
        United Nations Convention against Corruption; and
            (C) is bound by the legal obligations set forth in the 
        European Convention on Human Rights.
        (3) States voluntarily commit themselves to respect obligations 
    and responsibilities through the adoption of international 
    agreements and treaties, which must be observed in good faith in 
    order to maintain the stability of the international order. Human 
    rights are an integral part of international law, and lie at the 
    foundation of the international order. The protection of human 
    rights, therefore, particularly in the case of a country that has 
    incurred obligations to protect human rights under an international 
    agreement to which it is a party, is not left exclusively to the 
    internal affairs of that country.
        (4) Good governance and anti-corruption measures are 
    instrumental in the protection of human rights and in achieving 
    sustainable economic growth, which benefits both the people of the 
    Russian Federation and the international community through the 
    creation of open and transparent markets.
        (5) Systemic corruption erodes trust and confidence in 
    democratic institutions, the rule of law, and human rights 
    protections. This is the case when public officials are allowed to 
    abuse their authority with impunity for political or financial 
    gains in collusion with private entities.
        (6) The Russian nongovernmental organization INDEM has 
    estimated that bribes by individuals and businesses in the Russian 
    Federation amount to hundreds of billions of dollars a year, an 
    increasing share of the country's gross domestic product.
        (7) Sergei Leonidovich Magnitsky died on November 16, 2009, at 
    the age of 37, in Matrosskaya Tishina Prison in Moscow, Russia, and 
    is survived by a mother, a wife, and 2 sons.
        (8) On July 6, 2011, Russian President Dimitry Medvedev's Human 
    Rights Council announced the results of its independent 
    investigation into the death of Sergei Magnitsky. The Human Rights 
    Council concluded that Sergei Magnitsky's arrest and detention was 
    illegal; he was denied access to justice by the courts and 
    prosecutors of the Russian Federation; he was investigated by the 
    same law enforcement officers whom he had accused of stealing 
    Hermitage Fund companies and illegally obtaining a fraudulent 
    $230,000,000 tax refund; he was denied necessary medical care in 
    custody; he was beaten by 8 guards with rubber batons on the last 
    day of his life; and the ambulance crew that was called to treat 
    him as he was dying was deliberately kept outside of his cell for 
    one hour and 18 minutes until he was dead. The report of the Human 
    Rights Council also states the officials falsified their accounts 
    of what happened to Sergei Magnitsky and, 18 months after his 
    death, no officials had been brought to trial for his false arrest 
    or the crime he uncovered. The impunity continued in April 2012, 
    when Russian authorities dropped criminal charges against Larisa 
    Litvinova, the head doctor at the prison where Magnitsky died.
        (9) The systematic abuse of Sergei Magnitsky, including his 
    repressive arrest and torture in custody by officers of the 
    Ministry of the Interior of the Russian Federation that Mr. 
    Magnitsky had implicated in the embezzlement of funds from the 
    Russian Treasury and the misappropriation of 3 companies from his 
    client, Hermitage Capital Management, reflects how deeply the 
    protection of human rights is affected by corruption.
        (10) The politically motivated nature of the persecution of Mr. 
    Magnitsky is demonstrated by--
            (A) the denial by all state bodies of the Russian 
        Federation of any justice or legal remedies to Mr. Magnitsky 
        during the nearly 12 full months he was kept without trial in 
        detention; and
            (B) the impunity since his death of state officials he 
        testified against for their involvement in corruption and the 
        carrying out of his repressive persecution.
        (11) The Public Oversight Commission of the City of Moscow for 
    the Control of the Observance of Human Rights in Places of Forced 
    Detention, an organization empowered by Russian law to 
    independently monitor prison conditions, concluded on December 29, 
    2009, ``A man who is kept in custody and is being detained is not 
    capable of using all the necessary means to protect either his life 
    or his health. This is a responsibility of a state which holds him 
    captive. Therefore, the case of Sergei Magnitsky can be described 
    as a breach of the right to life. The members of the civic 
    supervisory commission have reached the conclusion that Magnitsky 
    had been experiencing both psychological and physical pressure in 
    custody, and the conditions in some of the wards of Butyrka can be 
    justifiably called torturous. The people responsible for this must 
    be punished.''.
        (12) Sergei Magnitsky's experience, while particularly 
    illustrative of the negative effects of official corruption on the 
    rights of an individual citizen, appears to be emblematic of a 
    broader pattern of disregard for the numerous domestic and 
    international human rights commitments of the Russian Federation 
    and impunity for those who violate basic human rights and freedoms.
        (13) The second trial, verdict, and sentence against former 
    Yukos executives Mikhail Khodorkovsky and Platon Lebedev evoke 
    serious concerns about the right to a fair trial and the 
    independence of the judiciary in the Russian Federation. The lack 
    of credible charges, intimidation of witnesses, violations of due 
    process and procedural norms, falsification or withholding of 
    documents, denial of attorney-client privilege, and illegal 
    detention in the Yukos case are highly troubling. The Council of 
    Europe, Freedom House, and Amnesty International, among others, 
    have concluded that they were charged and imprisoned in a process 
    that did not follow the rule of law and was politically influenced. 
    Furthermore, senior officials of the Government of the Russian 
    Federation, including First Deputy Prime Minister Igor Shuvalov, 
    have acknowledged that the arrest and imprisonment of Khodorkovsky 
    were politically motivated.
        (14) According to Freedom House's 2011 report entitled ``The 
    Perpetual Battle: Corruption in the Former Soviet Union and the New 
    EU Members'', ``[t]he highly publicized cases of Sergei Magnitsky, 
    a 37-year-old lawyer who died in pretrial detention in November 
    2009 after exposing a multimillion-dollar fraud against the Russian 
    taxpayer, and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, the jailed business magnate and 
    regime critic who was sentenced at the end of 2010 to remain in 
    prison through 2017, put an international spotlight on the Russian 
    state's contempt for the rule of law * * *. By silencing 
    influential and accomplished figures such as Khodorkovsky and 
    Magnitsky, the Russian authorities have made it abundantly clear 
    that anyone in Russia can be silenced.''.
        (15) The tragic and unresolved murders of Nustap Abdurakhmanov, 
    Maksharip Aushev, Natalya Estemirova, Akhmed Hadjimagomedov, Umar 
    Israilov, Paul Klebnikov, Anna Politkovskaya, Saihadji Saihadjiev, 
    and Magomed Y. Yevloyev, the death in custody of Vera Trifonova, 
    the disappearances of Mokhmadsalakh Masaev and Said-Saleh 
    Ibragimov, the torture of Ali Israilov and Islam Umarpashaev, the 
    near-fatal beatings of Mikhail Beketov, Oleg Kashin, Arkadiy 
    Lander, and Mikhail Vinyukov, and the harsh and ongoing 
    imprisonment of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Alexei Kozlov, Platon 
    Lebedev, and Fyodor Mikheev further illustrate the grave danger of 
    exposing the wrongdoing of officials of the Government of the 
    Russian Federation, including Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov, or of 
    seeking to obtain, exercise, defend, or promote internationally 
    recognized human rights and freedoms.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the United 
States should continue to strongly support, and provide assistance to, 
the efforts of the Russian people to establish a vibrant democratic 
political system that respects individual liberties and human rights, 
including by enhancing the provision of objective information through 
all relevant media, such as Radio Liberty and the internet. The Russian 
Government's suppression of dissent and political opposition, the 
limitations it has imposed on civil society and independent media, and 
the deterioration of economic and political freedom inside Russia are 
of profound concern to the United States Government and to the American 
people.

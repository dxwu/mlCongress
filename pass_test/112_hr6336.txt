        (1) Frederick Douglass, born Frederick Augustus Washington 
    Bailey in Maryland in 1818, escaped from slavery and became a 
    leading writer, orator, and publisher, and one of the Nation's most 
    influential advocates for abolitionism, women's suffrage, and the 
    equality of all people.
        (2) The contributions of Frederick Douglass over many decades 
    were crucial to the abolition of slavery, the passage of the 13th,

    the support for women's suffrage, and the advancement of African-
    Americans after the Civil War.
        (3) After living in New Bedford, Massachusetts, Frederick 
    Douglass resided for 25 years in Rochester, New York, where he 
    published and edited ``The North Star'', the leading African-
    American newspaper in the United States, and other publications.
        (4) Self-educated, Frederick Douglass wrote several influential 
    books, including his best-selling first autobiography, ``Narrative 
    of the Life of Frederick Douglass, an American Slave'', published 
    in 1845.
        (5) Frederick Douglass worked tirelessly for the emancipation 
    of African-American slaves, was a pivotal figure in Underground 
    Railroad activities, and was an inspiration to enslaved Americans 
    who aspired to freedom.
        (6) As a well-known speaker in great demand, Frederick Douglass 
    traveled widely, visiting countries such as England and Ireland, to 
    spread the message of emancipation and equal rights.

    the Seneca Falls Convention, a women's rights convention held in 
    Seneca Falls, New York in 1848.
        (8) During the Civil War, Frederick Douglass recruited African-
    Americans to volunteer as soldiers for the Union Army, including 2 
    of his sons, who served nobly in the Fifty-Fourth Massachusetts

    a fire destroyed his home in Rochester, New York.

    Marshal in 1877 and was named Recorder of Deeds for the District of 
    Columbia in 1881.
        (11) Frederick Douglass became the first African-American to 
    receive a vote for nomination as President of the United States at 
    a major party convention for the 1888 Republican National

    resident and consul-general to the Republic of Haiti.

    of the most important political activists in the history of the 
    United States.
        (14) Frederick Douglass died in 1895 in Washington, DC and is 
    buried in Rochester, New York.
        (15) Frederick Douglass's achievements and influence on the 
    history of the United States merit recognition in the United States 
    Capitol.

        around the world will mark the centennial of World War I, 
        including the entry of the United States into the war in April 
        1917.
            (2) America's support of Great Britain, France, Belgium, 
        and its other allies in World War I marked the first time in 
        United States history that American soldiers went abroad in 
        defense of liberty against foreign aggression, and it marked 
        the true beginning of the ``American century''.
            (3) Although World War I was at the time called ``the war 
        to end all wars'', in fact the United States would commit its 
        troops to the defense of foreign lands 3 more times in the 20th 
        century.
            (4) More than 4,000,000 men and women from the United 
        States served in uniform during World War I, among them 2 
        future presidents, Harry S. Truman and Dwight D. Eisenhower. 
        Two million individuals from the United States served overseas 
        during World War I, including 200,000 naval personnel who 
        served on the seas. The United States suffered 375,000 
        casualties during World War I, including 116,516 deaths.
            (5) The events of 1914 through 1918 shaped the world, the 
        United States, and the lives of millions of people.
            (6) The centennial of World War I offers an opportunity for 
        people in the United States to learn about and commemorate the 
        sacrifices of their predecessors.
            (7) Commemorative programs, activities, and sites allow 
        people in the United States to learn about the history of World 
        War I, the United States involvement in that war, and the war's 
        effects on the remainder of the 20th century, and to 
        commemorate and honor the participation of the United States 
        and its citizens in the war effort.

    SEC. 140. MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS PARTICIPATION.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:
        (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the 
    establishment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
    program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination and related 
    barriers continue to pose significant obstacles for minority- and 
    women-owned businesses seeking to do business in airport-related 
    markets across the Nation. These continuing barriers merit the 
    continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise 
    program.
        (2) Congress has received and reviewed testimony and 
    documentation of race and gender discrimination from numerous 
    sources, including congressional hearings and roundtables, 
    scientific reports, reports issued by public and private agencies, 
    news stories, reports of discrimination by organizations and 
    individuals, and discrimination lawsuits. This testimony and 
    documentation shows that race- and gender-neutral efforts alone are 
    insufficient to address the problem.
        (3) This testimony and documentation demonstrates that 
    discrimination across the Nation poses a barrier to full and fair 
    participation in airport-related businesses of women business 
    owners and minority business owners in the racial groups detailed 
    in parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and 
    has impacted firm development and many aspects of airport-related 
    business in the public and private markets.
        (4) This testimony and documentation provides a strong basis 
    that there is a compelling need for the continuation of the airport 
    disadvantaged business enterprise program and the airport 
    concessions disadvantaged business enterprise program to address 
    race and gender discrimination in airport-related business.
    (b) Standardizing Certification of Disadvantaged Business 
Enterprises.--Section 47113 is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(e) Mandatory Training Program.--
        ``(1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
    enactment of this subsection, the Secretary shall establish a 
    mandatory training program for persons described in paragraph (3) 
    to provide streamlined training on certifying whether a small 
    business concern qualifies as a small business concern owned and 
    controlled by socially and economically disadvantaged individuals 
    under this section and section 47107(e).
        ``(2) Implementation.--The training program may be implemented 
    by one or more private entities approved by the Secretary.
        ``(3) Participants.--A person referred to in paragraph (1) is 
    an official or agent of an airport sponsor--
            ``(A) who is required to provide a written assurance under 
        this section or section 47107(e) that the airport owner or 
        operator will meet the percentage goal of subsection (b) of 
        this section or section 47107(e)(1), as the case may be; or

        individuals under this section or section 47107(e).''.

Disadvantaged Small Business Concerns.--

    the Inspector General of the Department of Transportation shall 
    submit to Congress a report on the number of new small business 
    concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically 
    disadvantaged individuals, including those owned by veterans, that 
    participated in the programs and activities funded using the 
    amounts made available under this Act.
        (2) New small business concerns.--For purposes of subsection 
    (a), a new small business concern is a small business concern that 
    did not participate in the programs and activities described in 
    subsection (a) in a previous fiscal year.
        (3) Contents.--The report shall include--
            (A) a list of the top 25 and bottom 25 large and medium hub

        concerns owned and controlled by socially and economically

        activities funded using the amounts made available under this 
        Act;
            (B) the results of an assessment, to be conducted by the 
        Inspector General, on the reasons why the top airports have 
        been successful in providing such opportunities; and
            (C) recommendations to the Administrator of the Federal 
        Aviation Administration and Congress on methods for other 
        airports to achieve results similar to those of the top 
        airports.

    SEC. 405. AIRFARES FOR MEMBERS OF THE ARMED FORCES.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) the Armed Forces is comprised of approximately 1,450,000 
    members who are stationed on active duty at more than 6,000 
    military bases in 146 different countries;
        (2) the United States is indebted to the members of the Armed 
    Forces, many of whom are in grave danger due to their engagement 
    in, or exposure to, combat;
        (3) military service, especially in the current war against 
    terrorism, often requires members of the Armed Forces to be 
    separated from their families on short notice, for long periods of 
    time, and under very stressful conditions;
        (4) the unique demands of military service often preclude 
    members of the Armed Forces from purchasing discounted advance 
    airline tickets in order to visit their loved ones at home; and
        (5) it is the patriotic duty of the people of the United States 
    to support the members of the Armed Forces who are defending the 
    Nation's interests around the world at great personal sacrifice.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) all United States commercial air carriers should seek to 
    lend their support with flexible, generous policies applicable to 
    members of the Armed Forces who are traveling on leave or liberty 
    at their own expense; and
        (2) each United States air carrier, for all members of the 
    Armed Forces who have been granted leave or liberty and who are 
    traveling by air at their own expense, should--
            (A) seek to provide reduced air fares that are comparable 
        to the lowest airfare for ticketed flights and that eliminate 
        to the maximum extent possible advance purchase requirements;
            (B) seek to eliminate change fees or charges and any 
        penalties;
            (C) seek to eliminate or reduce baggage and excess weight 
        fees;
            (D) offer flexible terms that allow members to purchase, 
        modify, or cancel tickets without time restrictions, and to 
        waive fees (including baggage fees), ancillary costs, or 
        penalties; and
            (E) seek to take proactive measures to ensure that all 
        airline employees, particularly those who issue tickets and 
        respond to members of the Armed Forces and their family 
        members, are trained in the policies of the airline aimed at 
        benefitting members of the Armed Forces who are on leave or 
        liberty.

    portion of such amount to a traditional IRA within 180 days of 
    receipt of such amount (or, if later, within 180 days of the date 
    of the enactment of this Act), then such amount (to the extent so 
    transferred) shall be treated as a rollover contribution described 
    in section 402(c) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986. A qualified 
    airline employee making such a transfer may exclude from gross 
    income the amount transferred, in the taxable year in which the 
    airline payment amount was paid to the qualified airline employee 
    by the commercial passenger airline carrier.
        (2) Transfer of amounts attributable to airline payment amount 
    following rollover to roth ira.--A qualified airline employee who 
    has contributed an airline payment amount to a Roth IRA that is 
    treated as a qualified rollover contribution pursuant to section

    transfer to a traditional IRA, in a trustee-to-trustee transfer, 
    all or any part of the contribution (together with any net income

    traditional IRA will be deemed to have been made at the time of the 
    rollover to the Roth IRA, if such transfer is made within 180 days 
    of the date of the enactment of this Act. A qualified airline 
    employee making such a transfer may exclude from gross income the 
    airline payment amount previously rolled over to the Roth IRA, to 
    the extent an amount attributable to the previous rollover was 
    transferred to a traditional IRA, in the taxable year in which the 
    airline payment amount was paid to the qualified airline employee 
    by the commercial passenger airline carrier. No amount so 
    transferred to a traditional IRA may be treated as a qualified 
    rollover contribution with respect to a Roth IRA within the 5-
    taxable year period beginning with the taxable year in which such 
    transfer was made.
        (3) Extension of time to file claim for refund.--A qualified 
    airline employee who excludes an amount from gross income in a 
    prior taxable year under paragraph (1) or (2) may reflect such 
    exclusion in a claim for refund filed within the period of 
    limitation under section 6511(a) of such Code (or, if later, April 
    15, 2013).

        amounts which may be transferred to 1 or more traditional IRAs 
        under paragraphs (1) and (2) with respect to any qualified 
        employee for any taxable year shall not exceed the excess (if 
        any) of--
                (i) 90 percent of the aggregate airline payment amounts 
            received by the qualified airline employee during the 
            taxable year and all preceding taxable years, over
                (ii) the aggregate amount of such transfers to which 
            paragraphs (1) and (2) applied for all preceding taxable 
            years.
            (B) Special rules.--For purposes of applying the limitation 
        under subparagraph (A)--
                (i) any airline payment amount received by the 
            surviving spouse of any qualified employee, and any amount 
            transferred to a traditional IRA by such spouse under 
            subsection (d), shall be treated as an amount received or 
            transferred by the qualified employee, and
                (ii) any amount transferred to a traditional IRA which 
            is attributable to net income described in paragraph (2) 
            shall not be taken into account.
        (5) Covered executives not eligible to make transfers.--
    Paragraphs (1) and (2) shall not apply to any transfer by a 
    qualified airline employee (or any transfer authorized under 
    subsection (d) by a surviving spouse of the qualified airline 
    employee) if at any time during the taxable year of the transfer or 
    any preceding taxable year the qualified airline employee held a 
    position described in subparagraph (A) or (B) of section 162(m)(3) 
    with the commercial passenger airline carrier from whom the airline 
    payment amount was received.
    (b) Treatment of Airline Payment Amounts and Transfers for 
Employment Taxes.--For purposes of chapter 21 of the Internal Revenue 
Code of 1986 and section 209 of the Social Security Act, an airline 
payment amount shall not fail to be treated as a payment of wages by 
the commercial passenger airline carrier to the qualified airline 
employee in the taxable year of payment because such amount is excluded 
from the qualified airline employee's gross income under subsection 
(a).
    (c) Definitions and Special Rules.--For purposes of this section--
        (1) Airline payment amount.--
            (A) In general.--The term ``airline payment amount'' means 
        any payment of any money or other property which is payable by 
        a commercial passenger airline carrier to a qualified airline 
        employee--

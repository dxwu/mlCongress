    basis for finding that an individual named in an earlier 
    application as the inventor or a joint inventor derived such 
    invention from an individual named in the petitioner's application 
    as the inventor or a joint inventor and, without authorization, the 
    earlier application claiming such invention was filed. Whenever the 
    Director determines that a petition filed under this subsection 
    demonstrates that the standards for instituting a derivation 
    proceeding are met, the Director may institute a derivation 
    proceeding.

    respect to an invention that is the same or substantially the same 
    invention as a claim contained in a patent issued on an earlier 
    application, or contained in an earlier application when published 
    or deemed published under section 122(b), may not be filed unless 
    such petition is filed during the 1-year period following the date 
    on which the patent containing such claim was granted or the 
    earlier application containing such claim was published, whichever 
    is earlier.
        ``(3) Earlier application.--For purposes of this section, an 
    application shall not be deemed to be an earlier application with 
    respect to an invention, relative to another application, unless a 
    claim to the invention was or could have been made in such 
    application having an effective filing date that is earlier than 
    the effective filing date of any claim to the invention that was or 
    could have been made in such other application.
        ``(4) No appeal.--A determination by the Director whether to 
    institute a derivation proceeding under paragraph (1) shall be 
    final and not appealable.''.

    be effective as if included in the amendment made by section 3(i) 
    of the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act.

        shall be filled within 90 days after it occurs. A new member 
        who is appointed to fill a vacancy shall be appointed to serve 
        for the remainder of the predecessor's term.'';

        shall be deemed to terminate on December 1 of a year beginning 
        after the date of the enactment of this Act, regardless of

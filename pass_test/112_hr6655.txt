                                 An Act


 
      To establish a commission to develop a national strategy and 
 recommendations for reducing fatalities resulting from child abuse and 
                                neglect.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. COMMISSION.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Protect our Kids Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds that--
        (1) deaths from child abuse and neglect are preventable;
        (2) deaths from child abuse and neglect are significantly 
    underreported and there is no national standard for reporting such 
    deaths;
        (3) according to the Child Maltreatment Report of 2011, in 
    fiscal year 2011, 1,545 children in the United States are reported 
    to have died from child abuse and neglect, and many experts believe 
    that the actual number may be significantly more;
        (4) over 42 percent of the number of children in the United 
    States who die from abuse are under the age of 1, and almost 82 
    percent are under the age of 4;
        (5) of the children who died in fiscal year 2011, 70 percent 
    suffered neglect either exclusively or in combination with another 
    maltreatment type and 48 percent suffered physical abuse either 
    exclusively or in combination;
        (6) increased understanding of deaths from child abuse and 
    neglect can lead to improvement in agency systems and practices to 
    protect children and prevent child abuse and neglect; and
        (7) Congress in recent years has taken a number of steps to 
    reduce child fatalities from abuse and neglect, such as--
            (A) providing States with flexibility through the Child and 
        Family Services Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 to 
        operate child welfare demonstration projects to test services 
        focused on preventing abuse and neglect and ensuring that 
        children remain safely in their own homes;
            (B) providing funding through the Child and Family Services 
        Improvement Act of 2006 for services and activities to enhance 
        the safety of children who are at risk of being placed in 
        foster care as a result of a parent's substance abuse;
            (C) providing funding through the Fostering Connections to 
        Success and Increasing Adoptions Act of 2008 for grants to 
        facilitate activities such as family group decisionmaking 
        meetings and residential family treatment programs to support 
        parents in caring for their children; and
            (D) requiring States through the Child and Family Services 
        Improvement and Innovation Act of 2011 to describe how they 
        will improve the quality of data collected on fatalities from 
        child abuse and neglect.

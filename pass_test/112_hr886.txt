To require the Secretary of the Treasury to mint coins in commemoration 
  of the 225th anniversary of the establishment of the Nation's first 
   Federal law enforcement agency, the United States Marshals Service.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``United States Marshals Service 225th 
Anniversary Commemorative Coin Act''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    The Congress hereby finds as follows:
        (1) The United States Marshals, the first Federal law 
    enforcement officers in America, were established under section 27 
    of the Act of Congress entitled ``Chapter XX.--An Act to Establish 
    the Judicial Courts of the United States'' and enacted on September 
    24, 1789 (commonly referred to as the ``Judiciary Act of September 
    24, 1789''), during the 1st Session of the 1st Congress, and signed 
    into law by the 1st President of the United States, George 
    Washington.
        (2) George Washington had carefully considered the appointments 
    to the Judicial Branch long before the enactment of the Judiciary 
    Act of September 24, 1789, and nominated the first 11 United States 
    Marshals on September 24, and the remaining two Marshals on 
    September 25, 1789. The Senate confirmed all 13 on September 26, 
    1789, 2 days after the Judiciary Act was signed into law.
        (3) In 1969, by order of the Department of Justice, the United 
    States Marshals Service was created, and achieved Bureau status in 
    1974. The United States Marshals Service has had major significance 
    in the history of the United States, and has directly contributed 
    to the safety and preservation of this Nation, by serving as an 
    instrument of civil authority used by all 3 branches of the United 
    States Government.
        (4) One of the original 13 United States Marshals, Robert 
    Forsyth of Georgia, a 40-year-old veteran of the Revolutionary War, 
    was the first civilian official of the United States Government, 
    and the first of many United States Marshals and deputies, to be 
    killed in the line of duty when he was shot on January 11, 1794, 
    while trying to serve civil process.
        (5) The United States Marshals Service Commemorative Coin will 
    be the first commemorative coin to honor the United States Marshals 
    Service.
        (6) The United States should pay tribute to the Nation's oldest 
    Federal law enforcement agency, the United States Marshals Service, 
    by minting and issuing commemorative coins, as provided in this 
    Act.
        (7) A commemorative coin will bring national and international 
    attention to the lasting legacy of this Nation's oldest Federal law 
    enforcement agency.
        (8) The proceeds from a surcharge on the sale of such 
    commemorative coins will assist the financing of national museums 
    and charitable organizations.

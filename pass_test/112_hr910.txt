    To amend the Clean Air Act to prohibit the Administrator of the 
   Environmental Protection Agency from promulgating any regulation 
concerning, taking action relating to, or taking into consideration the 
 emission of a greenhouse gas to address climate change, and for other 
                               purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

                the term `air pollutant' in section 302(g) does not

SEC. 3. PRESERVING ONE NATIONAL STANDARD FOR AUTOMOBILES.

    Section 209(b) of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7543) is amended by 
adding at the end the following:
    ``(4) With respect to standards for emissions of greenhouse gases

SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS.

    It is the sense of the Congress that--
            (1) there is established scientific concern over warming of 
        the climate system based upon evidence from observations of 
        increases in global average air and ocean temperatures, 
        widespread melting of snow and ice, and rising global average 
        sea level;
            (2) addressing climate change is an international issue, 
        involving complex scientific and economic considerations;
            (3) the United States has a role to play in resolving 
        global climate change matters on an international basis; and
            (4) Congress should fulfill that role by developing 
        policies that do not adversely affect the American economy, 
        energy supplies, and employment.

            Passed the House of Representatives April 7, 2011.

            Attest:

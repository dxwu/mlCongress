    Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker

bill (H.R. 2584) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, 
environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2012, 
and for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. 
All points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. General debate 
shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and 
controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on 
Appropriations. After general debate the bill shall be considered for amendment 
under the five-minute rule. The amendment printed in section 2 of this 
resolution shall be considered as adopted in the House and in the Committee of 
the Whole. Points of order against provisions in the bill, as amended, for 
failure to comply with clause 2 of rule XXI are waived. During consideration of 
the bill for further amendment, the chair of the Committee of the Whole may 
accord priority in recognition on the basis of whether the Member offering an 
amendment has caused it to be printed in the portion of the Congressional Record 
designated for that purpose in clause 8 of rule XVIII. Amendments so printed 
shall be considered as read. When the committee rises and reports the bill, as 
amended, back to the House with a recommendation that the bill do pass, the 
previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and 
amendments thereto to final passage without intervening motion except one motion 
to recommit with or without instructions.

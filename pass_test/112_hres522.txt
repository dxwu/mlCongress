    Resolved, That at any time after the adoption of this resolution the Speaker 
may, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare the House resolved into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for consideration of the 
bill (H.R. 1173) to repeal the CLASS program. The first reading of the bill 
shall be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of the bill 
are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and shall not exceed 
one hour, with 40 minutes equally divided and controlled by the chair and 
ranking minority member of the Committee on Energy and Commerce and 20 minutes 
equally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on Ways and Means. After general debate the bill shall be considered 
for amendment under the five-minute rule for a period not to exceed three hours. 
It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of 
amendment under the five-minute rule the amendment in the nature of a substitute 
recommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce now printed in the bill. The 
committee amendment in the nature of a substitute shall be considered as read. 
All points of order against the committee amendment in the nature of a 
substitute are waived. No amendment to the committee amendment in the nature of

only by the Member who caused it to be printed or a designee and shall be 
considered as read if printed. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill 
for amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the House with 
such amendments as may have been adopted. Any Member may demand a separate vote 
in the House on any amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole to the bill 
or to the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute. The previous 
question shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to 
final passage without intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or 
without instructions.
            Attest:

                                                                          Clerk.

    TITLE I--EXPANSION OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME WITH RESPECT TO IRAN

SEC. 101. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ENFORCEMENT OF MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME AND 
              EXPANSION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SANCTIONS LAWS.

    It is the sense of Congress that the goal of compelling Iran to abandon 
efforts to acquire a nuclear weapons capability and other threatening activities 
can be effectively achieved through a comprehensive policy that includes 
economic sanctions, diplomacy, and military planning, capabilities and options, 
and that this objective is consistent with the one stated by President Barack 
Obama in the 2012 State of the Union Address: ``Let there be no doubt: America 
is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon, and I will take no 
options off the table to achieve that goal''. Among the economic measures to be 
taken are--
            (1) prompt enforcement of the current multilateral sanctions regime 
        with respect to Iran;
            (2) full, timely, and vigorous implementation of all sanctions 
        enacted into law, including sanctions imposed or expanded by this Act or 
        amendments made by this Act, through--
                    (A) intensified monitoring by the President and the 
                designees of the President, including the Secretary of the 
                Treasury, the Secretary of State, and senior officials in the 
                intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) of the 
                National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 401a(4)), as 
                appropriate;
                    (B) more extensive use of extraordinary authorities provided 
                for under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 
                U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) and other sanctions laws;
                    (C) reallocation of resources to provide the personnel 
                necessary, within the Department of the Treasury, the Department 
                of State, and the Department of Commerce, and, where 
                appropriate, the intelligence community, to apply and enforce 
                sanctions; and
                    (D) expanded cooperation with international sanctions 
                enforcement efforts;
            (3) urgent consideration of the expansion of existing sanctions with 
        respect to such areas as--
                    (A) the provision of energy-related services to Iran;
                    (B) the provision of insurance and reinsurance services to 
                Iran;
                    (C) the provision of shipping services to Iran; and
                    (D) those Iranian financial institutions not yet designated 
                for the imposition of sanctions that may be acting as 
                intermediaries for Iranian financial institutions that are 
                designated for the imposition of sanctions; and
            (4) a focus on countering Iran's efforts to evade sanctions, 
        including--
                    (A) the activities of telecommunications, Internet, and 
                satellite service providers, in and outside of Iran, to ensure 
                that such providers are not participating in or facilitating, 
                directly or indirectly, the evasion of the sanctions regime with 
                respect to Iran or violations of the human rights of the people 
                of Iran;
                    (B) the activities of financial institutions or other 
                businesses or government agencies, in or outside of Iran, not 
                yet designated for the imposition of sanctions; and
                    (C) urgent and ongoing evaluation of Iran's energy, national 
                security, financial, and telecommunications sectors, to gauge 
                the effects of, and possible defects in, particular sanctions, 
                with prompt efforts to correct any gaps in the existing 
                sanctions regime with respect to Iran.

SEC. 102. DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO EXPAND MULTILATERAL SANCTIONS REGIME.

    (a) Multilateral Negotiations.--Congress urges the President to intensify 
diplomatic efforts, both in appropriate international fora such as the United 
Nations and bilaterally with allies of the United States, for the purpose of--
            (1) expanding the United Nations Security Council sanctions regime 
        to include--
                    (A) a prohibition on the issuance of visas to any official 
                of the Government of Iran who is involved in--
                            (i) human rights violations in or outside of Iran;
                            (ii) the development of a nuclear weapons program 
                        and a ballistic missile capability in Iran; or
                            (iii) support by the Government of Iran for 
                        terrorist organizations, including Hamas and Hezbollah; 
                        and
                    (B) a requirement that each member country of the United 
                Nations--
                            (i) prohibit the Islamic Republic of Iran Shipping 
                        Lines from landing at seaports, and cargo flights of 
                        Iran Air from landing at airports, in that country 
                        because of the role of those organizations in 
                        proliferation and illegal arms sales; and
                            (ii) apply the prohibitions described in clause (i) 
                        to other Iranian entities designated for the imposition 
                        of sanctions on or after the date of the enactment of 
                        this Act;
            (2) expanding the range of sanctions imposed with respect to Iran by 
        allies of the United States;
            (3) expanding efforts to limit the development of petroleum 
        resources and the importation of refined petroleum products by Iran;
            (4) developing additional initiatives to--
                    (A) increase the production of crude oil in countries other 
                than Iran; and
                    (B) assist countries that purchase or otherwise obtain crude 
                oil or petroleum products from Iran to eliminate their 
                dependence on crude oil and petroleum products from Iran; and
            (5) eliminating the revenue generated by the Government of Iran from 
        the sale of petrochemical products produced in Iran to other countries.
    (b) Reports to Congress.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, and every 180 days thereafter, the President shall submit 
to the appropriate congressional committees a report on the extent to which 
diplomatic efforts described in subsection (a) have been successful that 
includes--
            (1) an identification of the countries that have agreed to impose 
        sanctions or take other measures to further the policy set forth in 
        subsection (a);
            (2) the extent of the implementation and enforcement of those 
        sanctions or other measures by those countries;

              INSTITUTIONS.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) providers of specialized financial messaging services are a 
        critical link to the international financial system;
            (2) the European Union is to be commended for strengthening the 
        multilateral sanctions regime against Iran by deciding that specialized 
        financial messaging services may not be provided to the Central Bank of 
        Iran and other sanctioned Iranian financial institutions by persons 
        subject to the jurisdiction of the European Union; and
            (3) the loss of access by sanctioned Iranian financial institutions 
        to specialized financial messaging services must be maintained.
    (b) Reports Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the

        report that contains--
                    (A) a list of all persons that the Secretary has identified 
                that directly provide specialized financial messaging services 
                to, or enable or facilitate direct or indirect access to such 
                messaging services for, the Central Bank of Iran or a financial 
                institution described in section 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the 
                Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act

                    (B) a detailed assessment of the status of efforts by the 
                Secretary to end the direct provision of such messaging services 
                to, and the enabling or facilitation of direct or indirect 
                access to such messaging services for, the Central Bank of Iran 
                or a financial institution described in that section.
            (2) Enabling or facilitation of access to specialized financial 
        messaging services through intermediary financial institutions.--For 
        purposes of paragraph (1) and subsection (c), enabling or facilitating 
        direct or indirect access to specialized financial messaging services

        section 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
        Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)(2)(E)(ii)) 
        includes doing so by serving as an intermediary financial institution 
        with access to such messaging services.
            (3) Form of report.--A report submitted under paragraph (1) shall be 
        submitted in unclassified form but may contain a classified annex.
    (c) Authorization of Imposition of Sanctions.--
            (1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), if, on or 
        after the date that is 90 days after the date of the enactment of this 
        Act, a person continues to knowingly and directly provide specialized 
        financial messaging services to, or knowingly enable or facilitate 
        direct or indirect access to such messaging services for, the Central 
        Bank of Iran or a financial institution described in paragraph 
        (2)(E)(ii) of section 104(c) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, 
        Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)), the 
        President may impose sanctions pursuant to that section or the

        with respect to the person.
            (2) Exception.--The President may not impose sanctions pursuant to 
        paragraph (1) with respect to a person for directly providing 
        specialized financial messaging services to, or enabling or facilitating 
        direct or indirect access to such messaging services for, the Central 
        Bank of Iran or a financial institution described in section 
        104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, 
        and Divestment Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)(2)(E)(ii)) if--
                    (A) the person is subject to a sanctions regime under its 
                governing foreign law that requires it to eliminate the knowing 
                provision of such messaging services to, and the knowing 
                enabling and facilitation of direct or indirect access to such 
                messaging services for--
                            (i) the Central Bank of Iran; and

                        identified under such governing foreign law for purposes 
                        of that sanctions regime if the President determines 
                        that--
                                    (I) the group is substantially similar to 
                                the group of financial institutions described in 
                                section 104(c)(2)(E)(ii) of the Comprehensive 
                                Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment 
                                Act of 2010 (22 U.S.C. 8513(c)(2)(E)(ii)); and
                                    (II) the differences between those groups of 
                                financial institutions do not adversely affect 
                                the national interest of the United States; and
                    (B) the person has, pursuant to that sanctions regime, 
                terminated the knowing provision of such messaging services to, 
                and the knowing enabling and facilitation of direct or indirect

serious human rights abuses and subject to sanctions pursuant to section 105 of 
the Comprehensive Iran Sanctions, Accountability, and Divestment Act of 2010 (22

        directing the commission of serious human rights abuses against citizens 
        of Iran or their family members on or after June 12, 2009, regardless of 
        whether such abuses occurred in Iran. For any such person who is not 
        included in such report, the Secretary of State should describe in the 
        report the reasons why the person was not included, including 
        information on whether sufficient credible evidence of responsibility 
        for such abuses was found.

                                 An Act


 
 To extend the term of the incumbent Director of the Federal Bureau of 
                             Investigation.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds that--
        (1) on May 12, 2011, the President requested that Congress 
    extend the term of Robert S. Mueller III as Director of the Federal 
    Bureau of Investigation by 2 years, citing the critical need for 
    continuity and stability at the Federal Bureau of Investigation in 
    the face of ongoing threats to the United States and leadership 
    transitions at the Federal agencies charged with protecting 
    national security;
        (2) in light of the May 1, 2011, successful operation against 
    Osama bin Laden, the continuing threat to national security, and 
    the approaching 10th anniversary of the attacks of September 11, 
    2001, the President's request for a limited, 1-time exception to 
    the term limit of the Director of the Federal Bureau of 
    Investigation, in these exceptional circumstances, is appropriate; 
    and
        (3) this Act is intended to provide a 1-time exception to the 
    10-year statutory limit on the term of the Director of the Federal 
    Bureau of Investigation in light of the President's request and 
    existing exceptional circumstances, and is not intended to create a 
    precedent.
SEC. 2. CREATION OF NEW TERM OF SERVICE FOR THE OFFICE OF DIRECTOR OF 
THE FEDERAL BUREAU OF INVESTIGATION.
    Section 1101 of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 
1968 (28 U.S.C. 532 note) is amended by adding at the end the 
following:
    ``(c)(1) Effective on the date of enactment of this subsection, a 
new term of service for the office of Director of the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation shall be created, which shall begin on or after August 3, 
2011, and continue until September 4, 2013. Notwithstanding the second 
sentence of subsection (b) of this section, the incumbent Director of 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the date of enactment of this 
subsection shall be eligible to be appointed to the new term of service 
provided for by this subsection, by and with the advice and consent of 
the Senate, and only for that new term of service. Nothing in this 
subsection shall prevent the President, by and with the advice of the 
Senate, from appointing an individual, other than the incumbent 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, to a 10-year term of 
service subject to the provisions of subsection (b) after the date of 
enactment of this subsection.
    ``(2) The individual who is the incumbent in the office of the 
Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the date of 
enactment of this subsection may not serve as Director after September 
4, 2013.
    ``(3) With regard to the individual who is the incumbent in the 
office of the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation on the 
date of enactment of this subsection, the second sentence of subsection 
(b) shall not apply.''.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.

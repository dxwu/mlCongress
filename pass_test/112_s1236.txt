                                 AN ACT


 
   To reduce the trafficking of drugs and to prevent human smuggling 
 across the Southwest Border by deterring the construction and use of 
                            border tunnels.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may be cited as the ``Border Tunnel Prevention Act of 
2011''.

SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds the following:
            (1) As the international border between the United States 
        and Mexico becomes more secure, trafficking and smuggling 
        organizations intensify their efforts to enter the United 
        States by increasing the number of tunnels and other 
        subterranean passages between Mexico and the United States.
            (2) Border tunnels are most often used to transport 
        narcotics from Mexico to the United States, but can also be 
        used to transport people and other contraband.
            (3) Between May 1990 and May 2011, law enforcement 
        authorities discovered 137 tunnels, 125 of which have been 
        discovered since September 2001. While law enforcement 
        authorities discovered only 2 tunnels in California between 
        1990 and 2001, there has been a dramatic increase in the number 
        of border tunnels discovered in California since 2001.
            (4) Section 551 of the Department of Homeland Security 
        Appropriations Act, 2007 (Public Law 109-295) added a new 
        section to title 18, United States Code (18 U.S.C. 555), 
        which--
                    (A) criminalizes the construction or financing of 
                an unauthorized tunnel or subterranean passage across 
                an international border into the United States; and
                    (B) prohibits any person from recklessly permitting 
                others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel or 
                subterranean passage on the person's land.
            (5) Any person convicted of using a tunnel or subterranean 
        passage to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or 
        illegal goods is subject to an enhanced sentence for the 
        underlying offense. Additional sentence enhancements would 
        further deter tunnel activities and increase prosecutorial 
        options.

    otherwise not according to law''.
    (d) Appeal From Certificate Actions.--
        (1) In general.--Upon a decision by the National Transportation 
    Safety Board upholding an order or a final decision by the 
    Administrator denying an airman certificate under section 44703(d) 
    of title 49, United States Code, or imposing a punitive civil 
    action or an emergency order of revocation under subsections (d) 
    and (e) of section 44709 of such title, an individual substantially 
    affected by an order of the Board may, at the individual's 
    election, file an appeal in the United States district court in 
    which the individual resides or in which the action in question 
    occurred, or in the United States District Court for the District 
    of Columbia. If the individual substantially affected by an order 
    of the Board elects not to file an appeal in a United States 
    district court, the individual may file an appeal in an appropriate 
    United States court of appeals.
        (2) Emergency order pending judicial review.--Subsequent to a 
    decision by the Board to uphold an Administrator's emergency order 
    under section 44709(e)(2) of title 49, United States Code, and 
    absent a stay of the enforcement of that order by the Board, the 
    emergency order of amendment, modification, suspension, or 
    revocation of a certificate shall remain in effect, pending the 
    exhaustion of an appeal to a Federal district court as provided in 
    this Act.
    (e) Standard of Review.--
        (1) In general.--In an appeal filed under subsection (d) in a 
    United States district court, the district court shall give full 
    independent review of a denial, suspension, or revocation ordered 
    by the Administrator, including substantive independent and 
    expedited review of any decision by the Administrator to make such 
    order effective immediately.
        (2) Evidence.--A United States district court's review under 
    paragraph (1) shall include in evidence any record of the 
    proceeding before the Administrator and any record of the 
    proceeding before the National Transportation Safety Board, 
    including hearing testimony, transcripts, exhibits, decisions, and 
    briefs submitted by the parties.
SEC. 3. NOTICES TO AIRMEN.
    (a) In General.--
        (1) Definition.--In this section, the term ``NOTAM'' means 
    Notices to Airmen.
        (2) Improvements.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
    the enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the Federal 
    Aviation Administration shall begin a Notice to Airmen Improvement 
    Program (in this section referred to as the ``NOTAM Improvement 
    Program'')--
            (A) to improve the system of providing airmen with 
        pertinent and timely information regarding the national 
        airspace system;
            (B) to archive, in a public central location, all NOTAMs, 
        including the original content and form of the notices, the 
        original date of publication, and any amendments to such 
        notices with the date of each amendment; and
            (C) to apply filters so that pilots can prioritize critical 
        flight safety information from other airspace system 
        information.
    (b) Goals of Program.--The goals of the NOTAM Improvement Program 
are--
        (1) to decrease the overwhelming volume of NOTAMs an airman 
    receives when retrieving airman information prior to a flight in 
    the national airspace system;
        (2) make the NOTAMs more specific and relevant to the airman's 
    route and in a format that is more useable to the airman;
        (3) to provide a full set of NOTAM results in addition to 
    specific information requested by airmen;
        (4) to provide a document that is easily searchable; and
        (5) to provide a filtering mechanism similar to that provided 
    by the Department of Defense Notices to Airmen.
    (c) Advice From Private Sector Groups.--The Administrator shall 
establish a NOTAM Improvement Panel, which shall be comprised of 
representatives of relevant nonprofit and not-for-profit general 
aviation pilot groups, to advise the Administrator in carrying out the 
goals of the NOTAM Improvement Program under this section.
    (d) Phase-in and Completion.--The improvements required by this 
section shall be phased in as quickly as practicable and shall be 
completed not later than the date that is 1 year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act.
SEC. 4. MEDICAL CERTIFICATION.
    (a) Assessment.--
        (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of the 
    enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General of the United States 
    shall initiate an assessment of the Federal Aviation 
    Administration's medical certification process and the associated 
    medical standards and forms.
        (2) Report.--The Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
    Congress based on the assessment required under paragraph (1) that 
    examines--
            (A) revisions to the medical application form that would 
        provide greater clarity and guidance to applicants;
            (B) the alignment of medical qualification policies with 
        present-day qualified medical judgment and practices, as 
        applied to an individual's medically relevant circumstances; 
        and
            (C) steps that could be taken to promote the public's 
        understanding of the medical requirements that determine an 
        airman's medical certificate eligibility.
    (b) Goals of the Federal Aviation Administration's Medical 
Certification Process.--The goals of the Federal Aviation 
Administration's medical certification process are--
        (1) to provide questions in the medical application form that--
            (A) are appropriate without being overly broad;
            (B) are subject to a minimum amount of misinterpretation 
        and mistaken responses;
            (C) allow for consistent treatment and responses during the 
        medical application process; and
            (D) avoid unnecessary allegations that an individual has 
        intentionally falsified answers on the form;
        (2) to provide questions that elicit information that is 
    relevant to making a determination of an individual's medical 
    qualifications within the standards identified in the 
    Administrator's regulations;
        (3) to give medical standards greater meaning by ensuring the 
    information requested aligns with present-day medical judgment and 
    practices; and
        (4) to ensure that--
            (A) the application of such medical standards provides an 
        appropriate and fair evaluation of an individual's 
        qualifications; and
            (B) the individual understands the basis for determining 
        medical qualifications.
    (c) Advice From Private Sector Groups.--The Administrator shall 
establish a panel, which shall be comprised of representatives of 
relevant nonprofit and not-for-profit general aviation pilot groups, 
aviation medical examiners, and other qualified medical experts, to 
advise the Administrator in carrying out the goals of the assessment 
required under this section.
    (d) Federal Aviation Administration Response.--Not later than 1 
year after the issuance of the report by the Comptroller General 
pursuant to subsection (a)(2), the Administrator shall take appropriate 
actions to respond to such report.

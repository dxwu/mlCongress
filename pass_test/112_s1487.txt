in good standing in an international trusted traveler program of the 
Department of Homeland Security.

section, the Secretary of Homeland Security may consult with 
appropriate private sector entities.

        to be necessary to comply with paragraph (2).
        (2) Limitation.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall 
    ensure that the total amount of the fees collected under paragraph

    the program.
        (3) Account for collections.--There is established in the

    Travel Card Account--
            (A) shall be credited to the appropriate account of the 
        Department of Homeland Security for expenses incurred in 
        carrying out this section; and
            (B) shall remain available until expended.
    (f) Termination of Program.--The Secretary of Homeland Security, in 
coordination with the Secretary of State, may terminate activities 
under this section if the Secretary of Homeland Security determines 
such action to be in the interest of the United States.

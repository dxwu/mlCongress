            (1) In general.--The Postal Service shall offer incentives 
        for voluntary separation under this section and the amendments 
        made by this section as a means of ensuring that the size and 
        cost of the workforce of the Postal Service is appropriate to 
        the work required of the Postal Service, including 
        consideration of--
                    (A) the closure and consolidation of postal 
                facilities;
                    (B) the ability to operate existing postal 
                facilities more efficiently, including by reducing the 
                size or scope of operations of postal facilities in 
                lieu of closing postal facilities; and
                    (C) the number of employees eligible, or projected 
                in the near-term to be eligible, for retirement, 
                including early retirement.
            (2) Percentage goal.--The Postal Service shall offer 
        incentives for voluntary separation under this section to a 
        sufficient number of employees as would reasonably be expected 
        to lead to an 18 percent reduction in the total number of 
        career employees of the Postal Service by the end of fiscal 
        year 2015.
            (3) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``career 
        employee of the Postal Service'' means an employee of the

                retirement coverage under chapter 83 or 84 of title 5, 
                United States Code.
    (d) Funding.--The Postal Service shall carry out subsection (a) and 
sections 8332(p) and 8411(m) of title 5, United States Code, as added

    (a) Definition.--In this section, the term ``retail postal 
service'' means service that allows a postal customer to--
            (1) purchase postage;
            (2) enter packages into the mail; and
            (3) procure other services offered by the Postal Service.
    (b) Establishment of Retail Service Standards.--Not later than 6 
months after the date of enactment of this Act, the Postal Service 
shall exercise its authority under section 3691 of title 39, United 
States Code, to establish service standards for market-dominant 
products in order to guarantee customers of the Postal Service regular 
and effective access to retail postal services nationwide (including in 
territories and possessions of the United States) on a reasonable 
basis.
    (c) Contents.--The service standards established under subsection 
(b) shall--
            (1) be consistent with--
                    (A) the obligations of the Postal Service under 
                section 101(b) of title 39, United States Code; and
                    (B) the contents of the plan developed under

                Enhancement Act of 2006 (39 U.S.C. 3691 note), and any

                this Act; and
            (2) take into account factors including--
                    (A) geography, including the establishment of 
                standards for the proximity of retail postal services 
                to postal customers, including a consideration of the 
                reasonable maximum time a postal customer should expect 
                to travel to access a postal retail location;
                    (B) the importance of facilitating communications 
                for communities with limited or no access to Internet,

                and other factors that may impact the ability of postal 
                customers, including businesses, to travel to a postal 
                retail location;

area, as defined by the Census Bureau, a summary of the determinations 
required under paragraph (4). Such determination and findings shall be 
made available to persons served by such post office.

        post office would continue after the closing to receive 
        substantially similar access to essential items, such as

        that are sent through the mail; or

consolidate a post office until 60 days after its written determination

any post office, station, or branch may be appealed by any person 
served by such office, station, or branch to the Postal Regulatory 
Commission within 30 days after such determination is made available to 
such person. The Commission shall review such determination on the 
basis of the record before the Postal Service in the making of such 
determination. The Commission shall make a determination based upon 
such review no later than 120 days after receiving any appeal under 
this paragraph. The Commission shall set aside any determination, 
findings, and conclusions found to be--

Service or order that the entire matter be returned for further 
consideration, but the Commission may not modify the determination of 
the Postal Service. The determination of the Postal Service shall be 
suspended until the final disposition of the appeal. The provisions of

                unless there is no significant community opposition to 
                such closure.
                    (B) Rule of construction.--Nothing in this 
                paragraph shall be construed to limit the authority of

excuse absentee voting, except as required for the immediate protection 
of health and safety.

States Code, as amended by this section, is amended by adding at the 
end the following:

        advancements, operational considerations, and other issues that 
        may be relevant to establishing an effective area and district 
        office structure; and
            (2) a 10-year plan, including a timetable, that provides 
        for consolidation of area and district offices within the

        nationwide delivery schedule of 5 or fewer days per week to 
        street addresses under the authority of the Postal Service 
        under title 39, United States Code, earlier than the date that 
        is 24 months after the date of enactment of this Act; and
            (2) on or after the date that is 24 months after the date 
        of enactment of this Act, the Postal Service may establish a 
        general, nationwide 5-day-per-week delivery schedule to street 
        addresses under the authority of the Postal Service under 
        section 3691 of title 39, United States Code, only in 
        accordance with the requirements and limitations under this 
        section.

change in delivery schedule under subsection (a)(2), the Postal Service 
shall--
            (1) identify customers, communities, and small businesses 
        for whom the change may have a disproportionate, negative 
        impact, including the customers identified as ``particularly 
        affected'' in the Advisory Opinion on Elimination of Saturday 
        Delivery issued by the Commission on March 24, 2011;
            (2) develop, to the maximum extent possible, measures to 
        ameliorate any disproportionate, negative impact the change 
        would have on customers and communities identified under 
        paragraph (1), including, where appropriate, providing or 
        expanding access to mailboxes for periodical mailers on days on 
        which the Postal Service does not provide delivery;
            (3) implement measures to increase revenue and reduce 
        costs, including the measures authorized under the amendments 
        made by sections 101, 102, 103, 207, and 211 of this Act;
            (4) evaluate whether any increase in revenue or reduction 
        in costs resulting from the measures implemented under 
        paragraph (3) are sufficient to allow the Postal Service, 
        without implementing a change in delivery schedule under 
        subsection (a), to achieve long-term solvency; and
            (5) not earlier than 15 months after the date of enactment 
        of this Act and not later than 9 months before the effective 
        date proposed by the Postal Service for the change, submit a

                Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the Committee on 
                Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
                Representatives;
                    (B) the Comptroller General of the United States; 
                and
                    (C) the Commission.
    (c) Review.--
            (1) Government accountability office.--Not later than 3 
        months after the date on which the Postal Service submits a 
        report under subsection (b)(5), the Comptroller General shall 
        submit to the Commission and to the Committee on Homeland 
        Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the 
        Committee on Oversight and Government Reform of the House of 
        Representatives a report that contains findings relating to 
        each of the following:
                    (A) Whether the Postal Service has adequately 
                complied with subsection (b)(3), taking into 
                consideration the statutory authority of and 
                limitations on the Postal Service.
                    (B) The accuracy of any statement by the Postal 
                Service that the measures implemented under subsection 
                (b)(3) have increased revenues or reduced costs, and 
                the accuracy of any projection by the Postal Service 
                relating to increased revenue or reduced costs 
                resulting from the measures implemented under 
                subsection (b)(3).
                    (C) The adequacy and methodological soundness of 
                any evaluation conducted by the Postal Service under 
                subsection (b)(4) that led the Postal Service to assert 
                the necessity of a change in delivery schedule under 
                subsection (a)(2).
                    (D) Whether, based on an analysis of the measures 
                implemented by the Postal Service to increase revenues 
                and reduce costs, projections of increased revenue and 
                cost savings, and the details of the profitability plan 
                required under section 401, a change in delivery 
                schedule is necessary to allow the Postal Service to 
                achieve long-term solvency.
            (2) Postal regulatory commission.--
                    (A) Request.--Not later than 6 months before the 
                proposed effective date of a change in delivery 
                schedule under subsection (a), the Postal Service shall 
                submit to the Commission a request for an advisory 
                opinion relating to the change.
                    (B) Advisory opinion.--
                            (i) In general.--The Commission shall--

                                for the issuance of advisory opinions

                                    (I) whether the measures developed 
                                under subsection (b)(2) ameliorate any 
                                disproportionate, negative impact that 
                                a change in schedule may have on 
                                customers, communities, and small 
                                businesses identified under subsection 
                                (b)(1); and

                                            (aa) whether the Postal

                                        measures to increase revenue 
                                        and reduce costs as required 
                                        under subsection (b)(3);
                                            (bb) whether the

                                        described in item (aa) has 
                                        increased revenues or reduced 
                                        costs, or is projected to 
                                        further increase revenues or 
                                        reduce costs in the future; and
                                            (cc) whether a change in 
                                        schedule under subsection 
                                        (a)(2) is necessary to allow 
                                        the Postal Service to achieve 
                                        long-term solvency.

                (1); and
                    (B) unless the Commission determines under 
                paragraph (2)(B)(ii)(II)(cc) that the Comptroller 
                General has concluded that the change is necessary to 
                allow the Postal Service to become profitable by fiscal 
                year 2015 and to achieve long-term solvency, without 
                regard to whether the Commission determines that the

                    (A) authorize the reduction, or require an 
                increase, in delivery frequency for any route for which

SEC. 209. PUBLIC PROCEDURES FOR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO MAILING 
              SPECIFICATIONS.

    (a) Notice and Opportunity for Comment Required.--Effective on the 
date on which the Postal Service issues a final rule under subsection 
(c), before making a change to mailing specifications that could pose a 
significant burden to the customers of the Postal Service and that is 
not reviewed by the Commission, the Postal Service shall--
            (1) publish a notice of the proposed change to the 
        specification in the Federal Register;
            (2) provide an opportunity for the submission of written 
        comments concerning the proposed change for a period of not 
        less than 30 days;
            (3) after considering any comments submitted under 
        paragraph (2) and making any modifications to the proposed 
        change that the Postal Service determines are necessary, 
        publish--
                    (A) the final change to the specification in the 
                Federal Register;

                            (ii) the customers of the Postal Service

        on which the Postal Service publishes the final change under 
        paragraph (3).
    (b) Exception for Good Cause.--If the Postal Service determines 
that there is an urgent and compelling need for a change to a mailing 
specification described in subsection (a) in order to avoid 
demonstrable harm to the operations of the Postal Service or to the 
public interest, the Postal Service may--
            (1) change the mailing specifications by--
                    (A) issuing an interim final rule that--

                            (ii) provides an opportunity for the 
                        submission of written comments on the interim 
                        final rule for a period of not less than 30 
                        days; and

                        interim final rule that is not earlier than 30 
                        days after the date on which the interim final 
                        rule is issued; and
                    (B) publishing in the Federal Register a response 
                to any comments submitted under subparagraph (A)(ii); 
                and
            (2) waive the requirement under paragraph (1)(A)(iii) or 
        subsection (a)(4).

        may participate in the hearing under this paragraph.
            (4) Completion.--Not later than 6 months after the date on 
        which the Commission commences the study under subsection (a),

        class, product, or type of mail service, in the same manner as 
        under subsection (a)(1)(A);
            (2) for any class of mail for which the Commission makes a 
        determination under paragraph (1), update the study under 
        subsection (a); and
            (3) include the study updated under paragraph (2) in the 
        annual written determination of the Commission under section 
        3653 of title 39, United States Code.
    (c) Postal Rates.--
            (1) Definition.--In this subsection, the term ``loss-
        making'', as used with respect to a class of mail, means a 
        class of mail that bears less than 100 percent of the costs 
        attributable to the class of mail, according to the most recent 
        annual determination of the Commission under subsection (a)(1) 
        or (b)(1), adjusted to account for the quantitative effect of 
        excess mail processing, transportation, or delivery capacity of 
        the Postal Service on the costs attributable to the class of 
        mail.
            (2) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date on

        each loss-making class of mail.
            (3) Considerations.--The Postal Service may establish 
        postal rates under paragraph (2) in a manner that ensures, to 
        the extent practicable, that a class of mail described in 
        paragraph (2) is not loss-making by--
                    (A) using the authority to increase rates under 
                section 3622(d)(1)(A) of title 39, United States Code;

                transportation, and delivery of such mail by the Postal 
                Service.
            (4) Unused rate adjustment authority.--Section 
        3622(d)(2)(C) of title 39, United States Code, shall be applied 
        by annually increasing by 2 percentage points any unused rate 
        adjustment authority for a class of mail that bears less than 
        90 percent of the costs attributable to the class of mail, 
        according to the most recent annual determination of the 
        Commission under subsection (a)(1) or (b)(1), adjusted to 
        account for the quantitative effect of excess mail processing, 
        transportation, or delivery capacity of the Postal Service on 
        the costs attributable to the class of mail.

                the costs of a conference the total cost of which

                    (B) the use of an extremely high frequency active 
                electronically steered array antenna is the most cost 
                effective and lowest risk option available to support 
                extremely high frequency satellite communications for 
                the B-2 bomber aircraft.
            (2) A detailed plan setting forth the projected cost and 
        schedule for research, development, and testing on the 
        extremely high frequency active electronically steered array 
        antenna.

SEC. 214. MARINE CORPS GROUND COMBAT VEHICLES.

    (a) Limitation on Milestone B Approval for Marine Personnel Carrier 
Pending Analysis of Alternatives for Amphibious Combat Vehicle.--
            (1) Limitation.--Milestone B approval may not be granted 
        for the Marine Personnel Carrier (MPC) until 30 days after the 
        date of the submittal to the congressional defense committees 
        of an Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the Amphibious Combat 
        Vehicle (ACV).
            (2) Requirements for analysis of alternatives.--The 
        Analysis of Alternatives for the Amphibious Combat Vehicle 
        required by paragraph (1) shall include each of the following:
                    (A) An assessment of the ability of the Navy to 
                defend its vessels against attacks at distances from 
                shore ranging from 10-to-30 nautical miles during 
                amphibious assault operations in multiple potential 
                future conflict scenarios, based on existing and 
                planned and budgeted defense capabilities. The 
                assessment shall identify the key issues and variables 
                that determine survivability in each of the scenarios 
                assessed.
                    (B) An assessment of the amount of time Marines can 
                be expected to ride in a non-planing amphibious assault 
                vehicle without suffering a significant degradation in 
                combat effectiveness. The Marine Corps shall conduct 
                tests to support such assessment using existing 
                Amphibious Assault Vehicles and Expeditionary Fighting 
                Vehicle SDD-2 prototypes.
                    (C) An assessment of the armor protection levels 
                the Amphibious Combat Vehicle would require to satisfy 
                the requirements for the Marine Personnel Carrier 
                program, and an assessment whether a non-planing 
                Amphibious Combat Vehicle could practically achieve 
                that armor protection level while meeting other 
                objectives for mobility and cost.
                    (D) An assessment of whether an Amphibious Combat 
                Vehicle system could perform the range of amphibious 
                assault and land warfare missions for the Marine Corps 
                at a life-cycle cost approximately equal to or less 
                than the combined cost of the Amphibious Combat Vehicle 
                and Marine Personnel Carrier programs, and an 
                assessment of the extent to which a ground combat 
                vehicle fleet composed entirely of Amphibious Combat 
                Vehicles would enhance the amphibious assault 
                capabilities of the Marine Corps when compared with a 
                fleet composed of a mixture of Amphibious Combat 
                Vehicles and Marine Personnel Carriers.
            (3) Support of analysis of alternatives.--The Marine Corps 
        may conduct such technology development and demonstration, and 
        such other pre-acquisition activities, tests, exercises, and 
        modeling, as the Marine Corps considers necessary to support 
        the Analysis of Alternatives required by paragraph (1) and the 
        establishment of requirements for the Amphibious Combat 
        Vehicle.
    (b) Limitation on Milestone B Approval for Various Vehicles Pending 
Life-cycle Cost Assessment.--
            (1) Limitation.--Milestone B approval may not be granted 
        for any Marine Corps ground combat vehicle specified in 
        paragraph (2) until 30 days after the date of the submittal to 
        the congressional defense committees of a life-cycle cost 
        assessment of the portfolio of Marine Corps ground vehicles 
        performed by the Director of Cost Assessment and Program 
        Evaluation of the Department of Defense.
            (2) Covered vehicles.--The Marine Corps ground combat 
        vehicles specified in this paragraph are the following:
                    (A) The Marine Personnel Carrier.
                    (B) The Amphibious Combat Vehicle.
                    (C) The Joint Light Tactical Vehicle (JLTV).
                    (D) Any other ground combat vehicle of the Marine 
                Corps under development as of the date of the enactment 
                of this Act for which Milestone B approval has not been 
                granted as of that date.
    (c) Availability of Funds.--Of the amounts authorized to be 
appropriated for fiscal year 2012 by section 201 and available for 
research, development, test, and evaluation for the Navy as specified 
in the funding tables in section 4201 for Program Elements 0603611M and

                  Subtitle C--Missile Defense Matters

SEC. 231. ENHANCED OVERSIGHT OF MISSILE DEFENSE ACQUISITION PROGRAMS.

    (a) In General.--Section 225 of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 Stat. 
4170; 10 U.S.C. 233 note) is amended--
            (1) in subsection (d), by striking ``each report'' and 
        inserting ``each of the first three reports''; and
            (2) by adding at the end the following new subsection:
    ``(e) Comptroller General Assessment.--(1) At the end of each of 
fiscal years 2012 through 2015, the Comptroller General of the United 
States shall review the annual reports on acquisition baselines and 
variances required under subsection (c) and assess the extent to which 
the Missile Defense Agency has achieved its acquisition goals and 
objectives.
    ``(2) Not later than February 15, 2013, and each year thereafter 
through 2016, the Comptroller General shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the assessment under paragraph (1) with 
respect to the acquisition baselines for the preceding fiscal year. 
Each report shall include any findings and recommendations on missile 
defense acquisition programs and accountability therefore that the 
Comptroller General considers appropriate.''.
    (b) Repeal of Superseded Reporting Authority.--Section 232 of the 
National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 (10 U.S.C. 2431 
note) is amended by striking subsection (g).

SEC. 232. GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Ground-based Midcourse Defense (GMD) element of the 
        Ballistic Missile Defense System was deployed initially in 2004 
        as a contingency capability to provide initial protection of 
        the United States homeland against potential limited long-range 
        missile attacks by nations such as North Korea and Iran.
            (2) As the Director of Operational Test and Evaluation has 
        reported, prior to the decision in December 2002 to deploy the 
        system, an operationally representative variant of the Ground-
        Based Interceptor had not been flight-tested.
            (3) As the Department of Defense and the Government 
        Accountability Office have acknowledged, the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system experienced high levels of concurrency 
        in development and deployment, which led to a number of 
        problems. In April 2011, the Missile Defense Agency 
        acknowledged that the system ``is still evolving and has not 
        attained a stable configuration between missiles. It is still 
        an `operational prototype' system''.
            (4) The Director of Operational Test and Evaluation 
        reported in December 2010 that there have not been enough 
        flight tests of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system to 
        permit an objective assessment of its operational 
        effectiveness, suitability data remain insufficient, evaluation 
        of survivability remains limited, and a ``full end-to end 
        performance assessment is still a minimum of 6 years away''.
            (5) As is to be expected from a developmental system, the 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense system has experienced a number 
        of technical problems in flight tests. Many of these problems 
        have been resolved with further development, as demonstrated in 
        successful flight tests. The system has been under continuous 
        improvement since it was first deployed, but has not yet 
        obtained desired levels of effectiveness, suitability, or 
        reliability.
            (6) In 2009, the Secretary of Defense announced that the 
        Department of Defense would refocus efforts on improving the 
        operational capability, reliability, and availability of the 
        Ground-based Midcourse Defense system in order to maintain its 
        ability to stay ahead of projected threats from North Korea and 
        Iran for the foreseeable future.
            (7) In February 2010 the Ballistic Missile Defense Review 
        stated the United States is currently protected against limited 
        intercontinental ballistic missile attacks as a result of 
        investments made over the past decade in the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system and reiterated the commitment to 
        improving the operational capability, reliability, and 
        availability of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense System.
            (8) The two most recent flight tests of the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system, using the newest Capability 
        Enhancement-2 Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicle (EKV) design, each 
        failed to achieve the intended interception of a target.
            (9) The two most recent flight tests are not indicative of 
        the functionality of the Capability Enhancement-1 Exo-
        atmospheric Kill Vehicle design, which continues to provide the 
        United States protection against a limited intercontinental 
        ballistic missile attack.
            (10) The Missile Defense Agency established a Failure 
        Review Board to determine the root cause of the December 2010 
        flight-test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system. Its analysis will inform the proposed correction of the 
        problem causing the flight-test failure.
            (11) The Missile Defense Agency plans to design a 
        correction of the problem causing the December 2010 flight-test 
        failure and to verify the correction through extensive modeling 
        and simulation, ground testing, and two flight tests, the first 
        of which will not be an interception test.
            (12) Until completing the verification of its corrective 
        action, the Missile Defense Agency has suspended further 
        production of Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles to ensure that 
        potential flaws are not incorporated into them, and to permit 
        any corrective action that may be needed to Exo-atmospheric 
        Kill Vehicles at minimal cost and schedule risk.
            (13) The Director of the Missile Defense Agency has 
        testified that the Missile Defense Agency has sufficient 
        funding available and planned for fiscal years 2011 and 2012, 
        respectively, to implement the planned correction of the 
        problem causing the December 2010 flight-test failure.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is essential for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        element of the Ballistic Missile Defense System to achieve the 
        levels of reliability, availability, sustainability, and 
        operational performance that will allow it to continue 
        providing protection of the United States homeland, throughout 
        its operational service life, against limited future missile 
        attacks from nations such as North Korea and Iran;
            (2) the Missile Defense Agency should, as its highest 
        priority, determine the root cause of the December 2010 flight-
        test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense system, 
        design a correction of the problem causing the flight-test 
        failure, and verify through extensive testing that such 
        correction is effective and will allow the Ground-based 
        Midcourse Defense system to reach levels described in paragraph 
        (1);
            (3) before verifying the success of the correction of the 
        problem causing the December 2010 flight-test failure, the 
        Missile Defense Agency should suspend further production of 
        Exo-atmospheric Kill Vehicles to ensure that they will not be 
        deployed with any component or design flaws that may have 
        caused the flight-test failure;
            (4) after the Missile Defense Agency has verified the 
        correction of the problem causing the December 2010 flight-test 
        failure, including through the two previously unplanned 
        verification flight tests, the Agency should assess the need 
        for any additional Ground-Based Interceptors and any additional 
        steps needed for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense testing and 
        sustainment program; and
            (5) the Department of Defense should plan for and budget 
        sufficient future funds for the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        program to ensure the ability to complete and verify an 
        effective correction of the problem causing the December 2010 
        flight-test failure, and to mitigate the effects of corrective 
        actions on previously planned program work that is deferred as 
        a result of such corrective actions.
    (c) Reports.--
            (1) Reports required.--Not later than 120 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, and one year thereafter, the 
        Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional defense 
        committees a report describing the plan of the Department of 
        Defense to correct the problem causing the December 2010 
        flight-test failure of the Ground-based Midcourse Defense 
        system, and any progress toward the achievement of that plan.
            (2) Elements.--Each report required by paragraph (1) shall 
        include the following:
                    (A) A detailed discussion of the plan to correct 
                the problem described in that paragraph, including 
                plans for diagnostic, design, testing, and 
                manufacturing actions.
                    (B) A detailed discussion of any results obtained 
                from the plan described in subparagraph (A) as of the 
                date of such report, including diagnostic, design, 
                testing, or manufacturing results.
                    (C) A description of any cost or schedule impact of 
                the plan on the Ground-based Midcourse Defense program, 
                including on testing, production, refurbishment, or 
                deferred work.
                    (D) A description of any planned adjustments to the 
                Ground-based Midcourse Defense program as a result of 
                the implementation of the plan, including future 
                programmatic, schedule, testing, or funding 
                adjustments.
                    (E) A description of any enhancements to the

                for fiscal year 2010 pursuant to section 1105 of title 
                31, United States Code.
            (3) Form.--Each report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
        in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.

SEC. 233. MISSILE DEFENSE COOPERATION WITH RUSSIA.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) For more than a decade, the United States and Russia 
        have discussed a variety of options for cooperation on shared 
        early warning and ballistic missile defense. For example, on 
        May 1, 2001, President George W. Bush spoke of a ``new 
        cooperative relationship'' with Russia and said it ``should be 
        premised on openness, mutual confidence and real opportunities 
        for cooperation, including the area of missile defense. It 
        should allow us to share information so that each nation can 
        improve its early warning capability, and its capability to 
        defend its people and territory. And perhaps one day, we can 
        even cooperate in a joint defense''.
            (2) Section 1231 of the Floyd D. Spence National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001 (as enacted into law by 
        Public Law 106-398; 1654A-329) authorized the Department of 
        Defense to establish in Russia a ``joint center for the 
        exchange of data from systems to provide early warning of 
        launches of ballistic missiles and for notification of launches 
        of such missiles'', also known as the Joint Data Exchange 
        Center (JDEC).
            (3) On March 31, 2008, Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon 
        England stated that ``we have offered Russia a wide-ranging 
        proposal to cooperate on missile defense--everything from 
        modeling and simulation, to data sharing, to joint development 
        of a regional missile defense architecture--all designed to 
        defend the United States, Europe, and Russia from the growing 
        threat of Iranian ballistic missiles. An extraordinary series 
        of transparency measures have also been offered to reassure 
        Russia. Despite some Russian reluctance to sign up to these 
        cooperative missile defense activities, we continue to work 
        toward this goal''.
            (4) On July 6, 2009, President Barack Obama and Russian 
        President Dmitry Medvedev issued a joint statement on missile 
        defense issues, which stated that ``Russia and the United 
        States plan to continue the discussion concerning the 
        establishment of cooperation in responding to the challenge of 
        ballistic missile proliferation. . . We have instructed our 
        experts to work together to analyze the ballistic missile 
        challenges of the 21st century and to prepare appropriate 
        recommendations''.
            (5) The February 2010 report of the Ballistic Missile 
        Defense Review established as one of its central policy pillars 
        that increased international missile defense cooperation is in 
        the national security interest of the United States and, with 
        regard to cooperation with Russia, the United States ``is 
        pursuing a broad agenda focused on shared early warning of 
        missile launches, possible technical cooperation, and even 
        operational cooperation''.
            (6) at the November 2010 Lisbon Summit, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization (NATO) decided to develop a missile defense 
        system to ``protect NATO European populations, territory and 
        forces'' and also to seek cooperation with Russia on missile 
        defense. In its Lisbon Summit Declaration, the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization reaffirmed its readiness to ``invite Russia 
        to explore jointly the potential for linking current and 
        planned missile defence systems at an appropriate time in 
        mutually beneficial ways''. The new NATO Strategic Concept 
        adopted at the Lisbon Summit states that ``we will actively 
        seek cooperation on missile defence with Russia'', that ``NATO-
        Russia cooperation is of strategic importance'', and that ``the 
        security of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and Russia 
        is intertwined''.
            (7) In a December 18, 2010, letter to the leadership of the 
        Senate, President Obama wrote that the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization ``invited Russia to cooperate on missile defense, 
        which could lead to adding Russian capabilities to those 
        deployed by NATO to enhance our common security against common 
        threats. The Lisbon Summit thus demonstrated that the 
        Alliance's missile defenses can be strengthened by improving 
        NATO-Russian relations. This comes even as we have made clear 
        that the system we intend to pursue with Russia will not be a 
        joint system, and it will not in any way limit United States' 
        or NATO's missile defense capabilities. Effective cooperation 
        with Russia could enhance the overall efficiency of our 
        combined territorial missile defenses, and at the same time 
        provide Russia with greater security''.
            (8) Section 221(a)(3) of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
        Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 
        Stat. 4167) states that it is the sense of Congress ``to 
        support the efforts of the United States Government and the 
        North Atlantic Treaty Organization to pursue cooperation with 
        the Russian Federation on ballistic missile defense relative to 
        Iranian missile threats''.
            (9) In a speech in Russia on March 21, 2011, Secretary of 
        Defense Robert Gates cited ``the NATO-Russian decision to 
        cooperate on defense against ballistic missiles. We've 
        disagreed before, and Russia still has uncertainties about the 
        European Phased Adaptive Approach, a limited system that poses 
        no challenges to the large Russian nuclear arsenal. However, 
        we've mutually committed to resolving these difficulties in 
        order to develop a roadmap toward truly effective anti-
        ballistic missile collaboration. This collaboration may include 
        exchanging launch information, setting up a joint data fusion 
        center, allowing greater transparency with respect to our 
        missile defense plans and exercises, and conducting a joint 
        analysis to determine areas of future cooperation''.
            (10) In testimony to the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate on April 13, 2011, Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense 
        for Nuclear and Missile Defense Policy Bradley H. Roberts 
        stated that the United States has been pursuing a Defense 
        Technology Cooperation Agreement with Russia since 2004, and 
        that such an agreement is necessary ``for the safeguarding of 
        sensitive information in support of cooperation'' on missile 
        defense, and to ``provide the legal framework for undertaking 
        cooperative efforts.'' Further, Dr. Roberts stated that the 
        United States would not provide any classified information to 
        Russia without first conducting a National Disclosure Policy 
        review. He also stated that the United States is not 
        considering sharing ``hit-to-kill'' technology with Russia.
            (11) The United States and Russia already engage in 
        substantial cooperation on a number of international security 
        efforts, including nuclear nonproliferation, anti-piracy, 
        counter-narcotics, nuclear security, counter-terrorism, and 
        logistics resupply through Russia of coalition forces in 
        Afghanistan. These areas of cooperation require each side to 
        share and protect sensitive information, which they have both 
        done successfully.
            (12) The United States currently has shared early warning 
        agreements and programs of cooperation with eight nations in 
        addition to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The United 
        States has developed procedures and mechanisms for sharing 
        early warning information with partner nations while ensuring 
        the protection of sensitive United States information.
            (13) Russia and the United States each have missile launch 
        early warning and detection and tracking sensors that could 
        contribute to and enhance each others' ability to detect, 
        track, an defend against ballistic missile threats from Iran.
            (14) The Obama Administration has provided regular 
        briefings to Congress on its discussions with Russia on 
        possible missile defense cooperation.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) it is in the national security interest of the United 
        States to pursue efforts at missile defense cooperation with 
        Russia that would enhance the security of the United States, 
        its North Atlantic Treaty Organization allies, and Russia, 
        particularly against missile threats from Iran;
            (2) the United States should pursue ballistic missile 
        defense cooperation with Russia on both a bilateral basis and a 
        multilateral basis with its North Atlantic Treaty Organization 
        allies, particularly through the NATO-Russia Council;
            (3) missile defense cooperation with Russia should not ``in 
        any way limit United States' or NATO's missile defense 
        capabilities'', as acknowledged in the December 18, 2010, 
        letter from President Obama to the leadership of the Senate, 
        and should be mutually beneficial and reciprocal in nature; and
            (4) the United States should pursue missile defense 
        cooperation with Russia in a manner that ensures that--
                    (A) United States classified information is 
                appropriately safeguarded and protected from 
                unauthorized disclosure;
                    (B) prior to sharing classified information with 
                Russia, the United States conducts a National 
                Disclosure Policy review and determines the types and 
                levels of information that may be shared and whether 
                any additional procedures are necessary to protect such 
                information;
                    (C) prior to entering into missile defense 
                technology cooperation projects, the United States 
                enters into a Defense Technology Cooperation Agreement 
                with Russia that establishes the legal framework for a 
                broad spectrum of potential cooperative defense 
                projects; and
                    (D) such cooperation does not limit the missile 
                defense capabilities of the United States or its North 
                Atlantic Treaty Organization allies.
    (c) Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than 180 days after the

                cooperative measures would enhance the security of the 
                United States, and the manner in which such cooperative 
                measures fit within the larger context of United 
                States-Russian cooperation on international security.
                    (D) A description of the status of efforts to 
                conclude a bilateral Defense Technology Cooperation

        military technicians through use of a combination of active 
        duty personnel, reserve component personnel, State civilian 
        employees, and Federal civilian employees in a manner that 
        meets mission requirements without harming unit readiness;
            (2) identify various means for the management by the 
        Department of the transition of military technicians to a 
        system that relies on traditional personnel categories of 
        active duty personnel, reserve component personnel, and 
        civilian personnel, and for the management of any effects of 
        that transition on the pay and benefits of current military 
        technicians (including means for mitigating or avoiding such

            (3) determine whether military technicians who are employed 
        at the commencement of the transition described in paragraph

        military status, until separation or retirement, rather than 
        transitioned to such a traditional personnel category;
            (4) identify and take into account the unique needs of the 
        National Guard in the management and use of military 
        technicians;

        associated with military and civil service retirement 
        obligations;
            (6) develop a recommendation on the feasibility and 
        advisability of terminating the military technician as a 
        distinct personnel management category, and, if the termination 
        is determined to be feasible and advisable, develop 
        recommendations for appropriate legislative and administrative 
        action to implement the termination;
            (7) address any other matter relating to the management and 
        long-term viability of the military technician as a distinct 
        personnel management category that the Secretary shall specify 
        for purposes of the study; and

        technicians (dual status).
    (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the study required by subsection (a).

matters specified in subsection (b), and include such comments and 
recommendations on the results of the study as the Secretary considers

        supported by the primary Federal agency and its supporting 
        Federal entities, and the Adjutant General of the State or his 
        or her subordinate designee normally should be the principal

        the age of 12 years by--
                    ``(A) using force against any person;

                intoxicant, or other similar substance;
is guilty of rape of a child and shall be punished as a court-martial 
may direct.
    ``(b) Sexual Assault of a Child.--Any person subject to this

of 12 years is guilty of sexual assault of a child and shall be 
punished as a court-martial may direct.

child and shall be punished as a court-martial may direct.
    ``(d) Age of Child.--

        it need not be proven that the accused knew the age of the 
        other person engaging in the sexual act or lewd act. It is not 
        a defense that the accused reasonably believed that the child 
        had attained the age of 12 years.
            ``(2) Under 16 years.--In a prosecution under this section, 
        it need not be proven that the accused knew that the other 
        person engaging in the sexual act or lewd act had not attained

        subsection (b) (sexual assault of a child) or subsection (c) 
        (sexual abuse of a child), which the accused must prove by a 
        preponderance of the evidence, that the accused reasonably

        the child had in fact attained at least the age of 12 years.
    ``(e) Proof of Threat.--In a prosecution under this section, in 
proving that a person made a threat, it need not be proven that the 
person actually intended to carry out the threat or had the ability to 
carry out the threat.
    ``(f) Marriage.--In a prosecution under subsection (b) (sexual 
assault of a child) or subsection (c) (sexual abuse of a child), it is 
a defense, which the accused must prove by a preponderance of the 
evidence, that the persons engaging in the sexual act or lewd act were 
at that time married to each other, except where the accused commits a 
sexual act upon the person when the accused knows or reasonably should 
know that the other person is asleep, unconscious, or otherwise unaware 
that the sexual act is occurring or when the other person is incapable 
of consenting to the sexual act due to impairment by any drug, 
intoxicant, or other similar substance, and that condition was known or 
reasonably should have been known by the accused.
    ``(g) Consent.--Lack of consent is not an element and need not be 
proven in any prosecution under this section. A child not legally 
married to the person committing the sexual act, lewd act, or use of 
force cannot consent to any sexual act, lewd act, or use of force.

        or abuse of parental or similar authority is sufficient to 
        constitute the use of force.
            ``(3) Threatening or placing that child in fear.--The term 
        `threatening or placing that child in fear' means a 
        communication or action that is of sufficient consequence to 
        cause the child to fear that non-compliance will result in the 
        child or another person being subjected to the action 
        contemplated by the communication or action.

                humiliate, or degrade any person, or to arouse or 
                gratify the sexual desire of any person; or

                or in the presence of a child, including via any 
                communication technology, that amounts to a form of 
                immorality relating to sexual impurity which is grossly 
                vulgar, obscene, and repugnant to common propriety, and 
                tends to excite sexual desire or deprave morals with 
                respect to sexual relations.''.

    (b) Elements.--The guidance required by subsection (a) shall, at a 
minimum--
            (1) require the military departments to retain each 
        estimate of operating and support costs that is developed at 
        any time during the life cycle of a major weapon system, 
        together with supporting documentation used to develop the 
        estimate;
            (2) require the military departments to update estimates of 
        operating and support costs periodically throughout the life 
        cycle of a major weapon system, to determine whether 
        preliminary information and assumptions remain relevant and 
        accurate, and identify and record reasons for variances;
            (3) establish standard requirements for the collection of 
        data on operating and support costs for major weapon systems 
        and require the military departments to revise their Visibility 
        and Management of Operating and Support Costs (VAMOSC) systems 
        to ensure that they collect complete and accurate data in 
        compliance with such requirements and make such data available 
        in a timely manner;
            (4) establish standard requirements for the collection and 
        reporting of data on operating and support costs for major 
        weapon systems by contractors performing weapon system 
        sustainment functions in an appropriate format, and develop 
        contract clauses to ensure that contractors comply with such 
        requirements;
            (5) require the military departments--
                    (A) to collect and retain data from operational and 
                developmental testing and evaluation on the reliability 
                and maintainability of major weapon systems; and
                    (B) to use such data to inform system design 
                decisions, provide insight into sustainment costs, and 
                inform estimates of operating and support costs for 
                such systems;
            (6) require the military departments to ensure that 
        sustainment factors are fully considered at key life cycle 
        management decision points and that appropriate measures are 
        taken to reduce operating and support costs by influencing 
        system design early in development, developing sound 
        sustainment strategies, and addressing key drivers of costs;
            (7) require the military departments to conduct an 
        independent logistics assessment of each major weapon system 
        prior to key acquisition decision points (including milestone 
        decisions) to identify features that are likely to drive future 
        operating and support costs, changes to system design that 
        could reduce such costs, and effective strategies for managing 
        such costs;
            (8) include--
                    (A) reliability metrics for major weapon systems; 
                and

                            (i) to conduct further investigation and 
                        analysis into drivers of those metrics; and
                            (ii) to develop strategies for improving 
                        reliability, availability, and maintainability 
                        of such systems at an affordable cost; and
            (9) require the military departments to conduct periodic 
        reviews of operating and support costs of major weapon systems 
        after such systems achieve initial operational capability to 
        identify and address factors resulting in growth in operating 
        and support costs and adapt support strategies to reduce such 
        costs.
    (c) Retention of Data on Operating and Support Costs.--
            (1) In general.--The Director of Cost Assessment and 
        Program Evaluation shall be responsible for developing and 
        maintaining a database on operating and support estimates, 
        supporting documentation, and actual operating and support 
        costs for major weapon systems.
            (2) Support.--The Secretary of Defense shall ensure that 
        the Director, in carrying out such responsibility--
                    (A) promptly receives the results of all cost 
                estimates and cost analyses conducted by the military 
                departments with regard to operating and support costs 
                of major weapon systems;
                    (B) has timely access to any records and data of 
                the military departments (including classified and 
                proprietary information) that the Director considers 
                necessary to carry out such responsibility; and
                    (C) with the concurrence of the Under Secretary of 
                Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, may

        electronic parts, shall provide a written report on the matter 
        within 30 calendar days to the Inspector General of the 
        Department of Defense, the contracting officer for the contract 
        pursuant to which the supplies are purchased, and the 
        Government-Industry Data Exchange Program or a similar program 
        designated by the Secretary of Defense.
    (b) Inspection of Imported Electronic Parts.--
            (1) Inspection program.--The Secretary of Homeland Security 
        shall establish a risk-based methodology for the enhanced 
        targeting of electronic parts imported from any country, after 
        consultation with the Secretary of Defense as to sources of 
        counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic 
        parts in the supply chain for products purchased by the 
        Department of Defense.
            (2) Information sharing.--If United States Customs and 
        Border Protection suspects a product of being imported or 
        exported in violation of section 42 of the Lanham Act, and 
        subject to any applicable bonding requirements, the Secretary 
        of Treasury is authorized to share information appearing on, 
        and unredacted samples of, products and their packaging and 
        labels, or photographs of such products, packaging and labels, 
        with the rightholders of the trademarks suspected of being 
        copied or simulated, for purposes of determining whether the 
        products are prohibited from importation pursuant to such 
        section.
    (c) Contractor Systems for Detection and Avoidance of Counterfeit 
and Suspect Counterfeit Electronic Parts.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 270 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall 
        implement a program for the improvement of contractor systems 
        for the detection and avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts 
        and suspect counterfeit electronic parts.
            (2) Elements.--The program developed pursuant to paragraph 
        (1) shall--
                    (A) require covered contractors to adopt and 
                implement policies and procedures, consistent with 
                applicable industry standards, for the detection and 
                avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts and suspect 
                counterfeit electronic parts, including policies and 
                procedures for training personnel, designing and 
                maintaining systems to mitigate risks associated with 
                parts obsolescence, making sourcing decisions, 
                prioritizing mission critical and sensitive components, 
                ensuring traceability of parts, developing lists of 
                trusted and untrusted suppliers, flowing down 
                requirements to subcontractors, inspecting and testing 
                parts, reporting and quarantining suspect counterfeit 
                electronic parts and counterfeit electronic parts, and 
                taking corrective action;
                    (B) establish processes for the review and approval 
                or disapproval of contractor systems for the detection 
                and avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts and 
                suspect counterfeit electronic parts, comparable to the 
                processes established for contractor business systems 
                under section 893 of the Ike Skelton National Defense 
                Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-
                383; 124 Stat. 4311; 10 U.S.C. 2302 note); and
                    (C) effective beginning one year after the date of 
                the enactment of this Act, authorize the withholding of 
                payments as provided in subsection (c) of such section, 
                in the event that a contractor system for detection and 
                avoidance of counterfeit electronic parts is 
                disapproved pursuant to subparagraph (B) and has not 
                subsequently received approval.
            (3) Covered contractor and covered contract defined.--In 
        this subsection, the terms ``covered contractor'' and ``covered 
        contract'' have the meanings given such terms in section 893(f) 
        of the Ike Skelton National Defense Authorization Act for 
        Fiscal Year 2011 (Public Law 111-383; 124 Stat. 4312; 10 U.S.C. 
        2302 note).
    (d) Department of Defense Responsibilities.--Not later than 270 
days after the date of the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of 
Defense shall take steps to address shortcomings in Department of 
Defense systems for the detection and avoidance of counterfeit 
electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic parts. Such steps 
shall include, at a minimum, the following:
            (1) Policies and procedures applicable to Department of 
        Defense components engaged in the purchase of electronic parts, 
        including requirements for training personnel, making sourcing 
        decisions, ensuring traceability of parts, inspecting and 
        testing parts, reporting and quarantining suspect counterfeit 
        electronic parts and counterfeit electronic parts, and taking 
        corrective action. The policies and procedures developed by the 
        Secretary under this paragraph shall prioritize mission 
        critical and sensitive components.
            (2) The establishment of a system for ensuring that 
        government employees who become aware of, or have reason to 
        suspect, that any end item, component, part, or material 
        contained in supplies purchased by or for the Department of 
        Defense contains counterfeit electronic parts or suspect 
        counterfeit electronic parts are required to provide a written 
        report on the matter within 30 calendar days to the Inspector 
        General of the Department of Defense, the contracting officer 
        for the contract pursuant to which the supplies are purchased, 
        and the Government-Industry Data Exchange Program or a similar 
        program designated by the Secretary of Defense.
            (3) A process for analyzing, assessing, and acting on 
        reports of counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit 
        electronic parts that are submitted to the Inspector General of 
        the Department of Defense, contracting officers, and the 
        Government-Industry Data Exchange Program or a similar program 
        designated by the Secretary of Defense.
            (4) Guidance on appropriate remedial actions in the case of 
        a supplier who has repeatedly failed to detect and avoid 
        counterfeit electronic parts and suspect counterfeit electronic 
        parts or otherwise failed to exercise due diligence in the 
        detection and avoidance of such parts, including consideration 
        of whether to suspend or debar a supplier until such time as 
        the supplier has effectively addressed the issues that led to 
        such failures.
    (e) Trafficking in Counterfeit Military Goods or Services.--Section 
2320 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--
            (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following:

        Guidelines and policy statements applicable to persons 
        convicted of an offense under section 2320(a) of title 18,

              AND FIRE-RETARDANT FIBER AND MATERIALS FOR THE PRODUCTION 
              OF MILITARY PRODUCTS.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) Vehicle and aircraft fires remain a significant force 
        protection and safety threat for the members of the Armed 
        Forces, whether deployed in support of ongoing military 
        operations or while training for future deployment.
            (2) Since 2003, the United States Army Institute of 
        Surgical Research, the sole burn center within the Department 
        of Defense, has admitted and treated more than 800 combat 
        casualties with burn injuries. The probability of this type of 
        injury remains extremely high with continued operations in Iraq 
        and the surge of forces into Afghanistan and the associated 
        increase in combat operations.
            (3) Advanced fiber products currently in use to protect 
        first responders such as fire fighters and factory and refinery 
        personnel in the United States steel and fuel refinery 
        industries may provide greater protection against burn injuries 
        to members of the Armed Forces.
    (b) Report.--Not later than February 28, 2012, the Secretary of 
Defense shall submit to the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate 
and the Committee on Armed Services of the House of Representatives a 
report on fire-resistant and fire-retardant fibers and materials for 
the production of military products. The report shall include the 
following:
            (1) An identification of the fire-resistance or fire-
        retardant properties or capabilities of fibers and materials 
        (whether domestic or foreign) currently used for the production 
        of military products that require such properties or 
        capabilities (including include uniforms, protective equipment, 
        firefighting equipment, lifesaving equipment, and life support 
        equipment), and an assessment of the sufficiency, adequacy, 
        availability, and cost of such fibers and materials for that 
        purpose.
            (2) An identification of the fire-resistance or fire-
        retardant properties or capabilities of fibers and materials 
        (whether domestic or foreign) otherwise available in the United 
        States that are suitable for use in the production of military 
        products that require such properties or capabilities, and an 
        assessment of the sufficiency, adequacy, availability, and cost

                to weapons development and procurement schedules), 2432 
                (relating to Select Acquisition Reports, including 
                updated program life-cycle cost estimates), and 2433 
                (relating to unit cost reports) of title 10, United

                substantially mitigate the risk of recidivism with 
                regard to the individual to be transferred; and

Act, the President makes a proposal described in subsection (b), the 
President shall--
            (1) conduct a net assessment of the current and proposed

        of the United States are anticipated to be capable of meeting

        deterrence, extended deterrence, assurance of allies, and 
        defense; and
            (2) as soon as practicable after the date on which the

            (1) In general.--A proposal described in this subsection is 
        a proposal--
                    (A) to reduce the number of deployed nuclear 
                weapons of the United States to a level that is lower 
                than the level described in the Treaty between the

        activities.--The requirement to conduct the net assessment 
        under subsection (a) does not apply with respect to a proposal 
        described in paragraph (1)(B) to reduce the number of non-
        deployed nuclear weapons held by the United States if that

        activities.

        term ``hedge'' means the retention of non-deployed nuclear

        stockpiles to respond to a technical failure in the stockpile

SEC. 1072. REPORT ON PLAN TO IMPLEMENT ORGANIZATIONAL GOALS RECOMMENDED 
              IN THE NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY-2010.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) An urgent need exists to transform the United States 
        national security system in order to employ all elements of 
        national power effectively and efficiently to meet the 
        challenges of the 21st century security environment.
            (2) The Quadrennial Defense Review Independent Panel 
        emphasized this need in its July 2010 report, writing that 
        ``the Panel notes with extreme concern that our current Federal 
        Government structures--both executive and legislative, and in 
        particular those related to security--were fashioned in the 
        1940s and, at best, they work imperfectly today. . . A new 
        approach is needed''.
            (3) The National Security Strategy-May 2010 calls for such 
        a transformation of the United States national security system 
        through its identification of organizational changes already 
        underway, its recommendation of additional organizational 
        changes to be undertaken, and its commitment to strengthening 
        national capacity through a whole-of-government approach.
            (4) The realization of these organizational goals can best 
        be assured by the preparation of a report by the President on 
        progress being made on organizational changes already underway 
        and on an implementation plan for the organizational changes 
        newly recommended in the National Security Strategy.
    (b) Plan To Implement Recommendations Required.--
            (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of 
        the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit to the 
        appropriate committees of Congress a report setting forth a 
        plan to implement the organizational goals recommended in the 
        National Security Strategy-May 2010.

                        achieve such goal.
                            (iv) The preferred sequencing of the 
                        executive and legislative actions specified

                            (v) The preferred timetable for such 
                        executive and legislative actions and for 
                        achievement of such goal.
                            (vi) The progress that has already been

              STATES.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) In response to a question for the record from a March 
        29, 2011, hearing of the Committee on Armed Services of the 
        Senate, General C. Robert Kehler stated, ``The stockpile under 
        New START is appropriately sized to meet our deterrence 
        requirements and manage risk associated with our aging systems 
        and infrastructure. A recapitalized nuclear infrastructure 
        could also support potential reductions in the future non-
        deployed stockpile.''.
            (2) In response to an additional question for the record 
        from that hearing, General Kehler stated, ``Completion of 
        critical stockpile sustainment activities and restoration of 
        [the National Nuclear Security Administration's] production 
        infrastructure could enable future reductions in the quantity 
        of non-deployed warheads currently held to mitigate weapon and 
        infrastructure risk.''.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
            (1) sustained investments in the nuclear weapons stockpile 
        and the nuclear security complex are needed to ensure a 
        reliable nuclear deterrent; and
            (2) such investments could enable additional future 
        reductions in the hedge stockpile.
    (c) Report Required.--Not later than March 1, 2012, and annually 
thereafter, the Secretary of Defense shall submit to the congressional 
defense committees a report on the nuclear weapons stockpile of the 
United States that includes the following:
            (1) An accounting of the weapons in the stockpile as of the 
        end of the fiscal year preceding the submission of the report 
        that includes deployed and non-deployed weapons, including each 
        category of non-deployed weapon.
            (2) The planned force levels for each category of nuclear 
        weapon over the course of the future-years defense program 
        submitted to Congress under section 221 of title 10, United 
        States Code, for the fiscal year following the fiscal year in 
        which the report is submitted.

SEC. 1075. NUCLEAR EMPLOYMENT STRATEGY OF THE UNITED STATES.

    (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that any future 
modification to the nuclear employment strategy of the United States 
should maintain or enhance the ability of the nuclear forces of the 
United States to support the goals of the United States with respect to 
nuclear deterrence, extended deterrence, and assurances for allies, and 
the defense of the United States.
    (b) Reports on Modification of Strategy.--
            (1) In general.--Chapter 23 title 10, United States Code, 
        is amended by adding at the end the following new section:
``Sec. 491. Nuclear employment strategy of the United States: reports 
              on modification of strategy
    ``Not later than 30 days after the date on which the President 
issues a nuclear employment strategy of the United States that differs 
from the nuclear employment strategy of the United States then in 
force, the President shall submit to Congress a report setting forth 
the following:
            ``(1) A description of the modifications to nuclear 
        employment strategy of the United States made by the strategy 
        so issued.
            ``(2) An assessment of effects of such modification for the 
        nuclear posture of the United States.''.
            (2) Clerical amendment.--The table of sections at the 
        beginning of chapter 23 of such title is amended by adding at 
        the end the following new item:

                    (B) An assessment of the sufficiency of the numbers 
                and types of personnel available for cyberspace 
                operations, including an assessment of the balance of 
                military personnel, Department of Defense civilian 
                employees, and contractor positions, and the 
                availability of personnel with expertise in matters 
                related to cyberspace operations from outside of the

                Defense through other types of service agreements, as 
                well as obstacles that discourage cyberspace experts 
                and the Department of Defense from implementing new 
                organizational constructs.
                    (F) Identification of legal, policy, or

              DISSEMINATION OF ELETRO-OPTICAL IMAGERY COLLECTED BY 
              SATELLITES.

    (a) Secretary of Commerce Report.--
            (1) Report required.--Not later than April 15, 2012, the 
        Secretary of Commerce shall submit to Congress a report setting 
        forth the results of a comprehensive review of current 
        restrictions on the resolution of electro-optical (EO) imagery 
        collected from satellites that commercial companies may sell or 
        disseminate. The report shall include such recommendations for 
        legislative or administrative action as the Secretary considers 
        appropriate in light of the results of the review.
            (2) Considerations.--In conducting the review required for 
        purposes of the report under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall 
        take into consideration the following:
                    (A) Increases in sales of commercial satellite 
                imagery that would result from a relaxation of 
                resolution restrictions, and the ensuing benefit to the 
                United States Government, commerce, and academia from 
                an expanding market in satellite imagery.
                    (B) Current and anticipated deployments of 
                satellites built in foreign countries that can or will 
                be able to collect imagery at a resolution greater than 
                .5 meter resolution, and the sale or dissemination of 
                such imagery.
                    (C) The lead-time involved in securing financing, 
                designing, building, and launching the new satellite 
                imagery collection capabilities that would be required 
                to enable United States commercial satellite companies 
                to match current and anticipated foreign satellite 
                imagery collection capabilities.
                    (D) Inconsistencies between the current resolution 
                restrictions on the sale or dissemination of imagery 
                collected by United States commercial companies, the 
                availability of higher resolution imagery from foreign 
                sources, and the National Space Policy of the United 
                States, released by the President on June 28, 2010.
                    (E) The lack of restrictions on the sale or 
                dissemination of high-resolution imagery collected by 
                aircraft.
                    (F) The utility that higher resolution imagery 
                would bring to the United States Armed Forces, the 
                production of military geo-spatial information, 
                intelligence analysis, cooperation with allies, 
                scientific research efforts, and domestic disaster 
                monitoring and relief.

        of Congress a report setting forth an assessment of the 
        benefits and risks of relaxing current resolution restrictions 
        on the electro-optical imagery from satellites that commercial 
        United States companies may sell or disseminate, together with 
        recommendations for means of protecting national security 
        related information in the event of the relaxation of such 
        resolution restrictions.
            (2) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this

              TRANSITION OF SECURITY RESPONSIBILITIES FOR AFGHANISTAN 
              TO THE GOVERNMENT OF AFGHANISTAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) October 7, 2011, will mark the 10-year anniversary of 
        the start of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan.
            (2) Military operations in Afghanistan have cost United 
        States taxpayers more than $300,000,000,000 to date.
            (3) As of June 6, 2011, 1,599 members of the United States 
        Armed Forces have lost their lives in support of Operation 
        Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan and more than 11,000 have been 
        wounded.
            (4) On December 1, 2009, at a speech at the United States 
        Military Academy at West Point, New York, President Barack 
        Obama stated that the United States would begin the transfer of 
        United States Armed Forces out of Afghanistan in July 2011 with 
        the pace of reductions to be based upon conditions on the 
        ground.
            (5) In the December 2010 Afghanistan-Pakistan Annual 
        Review, President Obama reaffirmed that the core goal of the 
        United States strategy in Afghanistan is to disrupt, dismantle, 
        and defeat al Qaeda.
            (6) In January 2010, participants at the London Conference 
        pledged to develop a plan for phased transition to Afghan 
        security lead. The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) 
        and foreign ministers of the constituent elements of the 
        International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) endorsed the 
        Joint Framework for Transition in April 2010, and President 
        Obama and President Karzai of Afghanistan committed to the 
        process in a May 2010 joint statement.
            (7) At the Kabul Conference in July 2010, the international 
        community expressed its support for the objective of President 
        Karzai that the Afghanistan National Security Forces (ANSF) 
        should lead and conduct all military operations in all 
        provinces in Afghanistan by the end of 2014, support that was 
        later re-affirmed by North Atlantic Treaty Organization and 
        International Security Assistance Force member nations at the 
        Lisbon Summit in November 2010.
            (8) On May 1, 2011, in support of the goal to disrupt, 
        dismantle, and defeat al Qaeda, President Obama authorized a 
        United States operation that killed Osama bin Laden, leader of 
        al Qaeda. While the impact of his death on al Qaeda remains to 
        be seen, Secretary of Defense Robert Gates called the death of 
        bin Laden a ``game changer'' in a speech on May 6, 2011.
    (b) Benchmarks Required.--The President shall establish, and may 
update from time to time, a comprehensive set of benchmarks to evaluate 
progress being made toward the objective of transitioning and 
transferring lead security responsibilities in Afghanistan to the 
Government of Afghanistan by December 31, 2014.
    (c) Transition Plan.--The President shall devise a plan based on 
inputs from military commanders, NATO and Coalition allies, the 
diplomatic missions in the region, and appropriate members of the 
Cabinet, along with the consultation of Congress, for expediting the 
drawdown of United States combat troops in Afghanistan and accelerating 
the transfer of security authority to Afghan authorities.
    (d) Submittal to Congress.--The President shall include the most 
current set of benchmarks established pursuant to subsection (b) and 
the plan pursuant to subsection (c) with each report on progress toward 
security and stability in Afghanistan that is submitted to Congress 
under sections 1230 and 1231 of the National Defense Authorization Act 
for Fiscal Year 2008 (Public Law 110-181; 122 Stat. 385, 390).

of State Authorities Act of 2006 (22 U.S.C. 2349bb-6), the following is

SEC. 1245. IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL SECTOR 
              OF IRAN.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) On November 21, 2011, the Secretary of the Treasury 
        issued a finding under section 5318A of title 31, United States 
        Code, that identified Iran as a jurisdiction of primary money 
        laundering concern.
            (2) In that finding, the Financial Crimes Enforcement 
        Network of the Department of the Treasury wrote, ``The Central 
        Bank of Iran, which regulates Iranian banks, has assisted 
        designated Iranian banks by transferring billions of dollars to 
        these banks in 2011. In mid-2011, the CBI transferred several 
        billion dollars to designated banks, including Saderat, Mellat, 
        EDBI and Melli, through a variety of payment schemes. In making 
        these transfers, the CBI attempted to evade sanctions by 
        minimizing the direct involvement of large international banks 
        with both CBI and designated Iranian banks.''.
            (3) On November 22, 2011, the Under Secretary of the 
        Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, David Cohen, 
        wrote, ``Treasury is calling out the entire Iranian banking 
        sector, including the Central Bank of Iran, as posing terrorist 
        financing, proliferation financing, and money laundering risks 
        for the global financial system.''.
    (b) Designation of Financial Sector of Iran as of Primary Money 
Laundering Concern.--The financial sector of Iran, including the 
Central Bank of Iran, is designated as of primary money laundering 
concern for purposes of section 5318A of title 31, United States Code, 
because of the threat to government and financial institutions 
resulting from the illicit activities of the Government of Iran, 
including its pursuit of nuclear weapons, support for international 
terrorism, and efforts to deceive responsible financial institutions 
and evade sanctions.
    (c) Freezing of Assets of Iranian Financial Institutions.--The 
President shall, pursuant to the International Emergency Economic 
Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), block and prohibit all 
transactions in all property and interests in property of an Iranian 
financial institution if such property and interests in property are in 
the United States, come within the United States, or are or come within 
the possession or control of a United States person.
    (d) Imposition of Sanctions With Respect to the Central Bank of 
Iran and Other Iranian Financial Institutions.--
            (1) In general.--Except as specifically provided in this 
        subsection, beginning on the date that is 60 days after the 
        date of the enactment of this Act, the President--
                    (A) shall prohibit the opening or maintaining in 
                the United States of a correspondent account or a 
                payable-through account by a foreign financial 
                institution that the President determines has knowingly 
                conducted or facilitated any significant financial 
                transaction with the Central Bank of Iran or another 
                Iranian financial institution designated by the 
                Secretary of the Treasury for the imposition of 
                sanctions pursuant to the International Emergency 
                Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.); and
                    (B) may impose sanctions pursuant to the 
                International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 
                1701 et seq.) with respect to the Central Bank of Iran.
            (2) Exception for sales of food, medicine, and medical 
        devices.--The President may not impose sanctions under 
        paragraph (1) with respect to any person for conducting or 
        facilitating a transaction for the sale of food, medicine, or 
        medical devices to Iran.
            (3) Applicability of sanctions with respect to foreign 
        central banks.--Except as provided in paragraph (4), sanctions 
        imposed under paragraph (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a 
        foreign financial institution owned or controlled by the 
        government of a foreign country, including a central bank of a 
        foreign country, only insofar as it engages in a financial 
        transaction for the sale or purchase of petroleum or petroleum 
        products to or from Iran conducted or facilitated on or after 
        that date that is 180 days after the date of the enactment of 
        this Act.
            (4) Applicability of sanctions with respect to petroleum 
        transactions.--
                    (A) Report required.--Not later than 60 days after 
                the date of the enactment of this Act, and every 60 
                days thereafter, the Administrator of the Energy 
                Information Administration, in consultation with the 
                Secretary of the Treasury, shall submit to Congress a 
                report on the availability and price of petroleum and 
                petroleum products produced in countries other than 
                Iran in the 60-day period preceding the submission of 
                the report.
                    (B) Determination required.--Not later than 90 days 
                after the date of the enactment of the Act, and every 
                180 days thereafter, the President shall make a 
                determination, based on the reports required by 
                subparagraph (A), of whether the price and supply of 
                petroleum and petroleum products produced in countries 
                other than Iran is sufficient to permit purchasers of 
                petroleum and petroleum products from Iran to reduce 
                significantly in volume their purchases from Iran.
                    (C) Application of sanctions.--Except as provided 
                in subparagraph (D), sanctions imposed under paragraph 
                (1)(A) shall apply with respect to a financial 
                transaction conducted or facilitated by a foreign 
                financial institution on or after the date that is 180 
                days after the date of the enactment of this Act for 
                the purchase of petroleum or petroleum products from 
                Iran if the President determines pursuant to 
                subparagraph (B) that there is a sufficient supply of 
                petroleum and petroleum products from countries other 
                than Iran to permit a significant reduction in the 
                volume of petroleum and petroleum products purchased 
                from Iran by or through foreign financial institutions.
                    (D) Exception.--Sanctions imposed pursuant to 
                paragraph (1) shall not apply with respect to a foreign 
                financial institution if the President determines and 
                reports to Congress, not later than 90 days after the 
                date on which the President makes the determination 
                required by subparagraph (B), and every 180 days 
                thereafter, that the country with primary jurisdiction 
                over the foreign financial institution has 
                significantly reduced its volume of crude oil purchases 
                from Iran during the period beginning on the date on 
                which the President submitted the last report with 
                respect to the country under this subparagraph.

        sanctions under paragraph (1) for a period of not more than 120 
        days, and may renew that waiver for additional periods of not 
        more than 120 days, if the President--
                    (A) determines that such a waiver is vital to the 
                national security of the United States; and
                    (B) submits to Congress a report--

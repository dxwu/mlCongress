                                 An Act


 
   To require a report on the designation of the Haqqani Network as a 
         foreign terrorist organization and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Haqqani Network Terrorist 
Designation Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. REPORT ON DESIGNATION OF THE HAQQANI NETWORK AS A FOREIGN 
TERRORIST ORGANIZATION.
    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
        (1) A report of the Congressional Research Service on relations 
    between the United States and Pakistan states that ``[t]he 
    terrorist network led by Jalaluddin Haqqani and his son Sirajuddin, 
    based in the FATA, is commonly identified as the most dangerous of 
    Afghan insurgent groups battling U.S.-led forces in eastern 
    Afghanistan''.
        (2) The report further states that, in mid-2011, the Haqqanis 
    undertook several high-visibility attacks in Afghanistan. First, a 
    late June assault on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul by 8 
    Haqqani gunmen and suicide bombers left 18 people dead. Then, on 
    September 10, a truck bomb attack on a United States military base 
    by Haqqani fighters in the Wardak province injured 77 United States 
    troops and killed 5 Afghans. A September 13 attack on the United 
    States Embassy compound in Kabul involved an assault that sparked a 
    20-hour-long gun battle and left 16 Afghans dead, 5 police officers 
    and at least 6 children among them.
        (3) The report further states that ``U.S. and Afghan officials 
    concluded the Embassy attackers were members of the Haqqani 
    network''.
        (4) In September 22, 2011, testimony before the Committee on 
    Armed Services of the Senate, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff 
    Admiral Mullen stated that ``[t]he Haqqani network, for one, acts 
    as a veritable arm of Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence 
    agency. With ISI support, Haqqani operatives plan and conducted 
    that [September 13] truck bomb attack, as well as the assault on 
    our embassy. We also have credible evidence they were behind the 
    June 28th attack on the Intercontinental Hotel in Kabul and a host 
    of other smaller but effective operations''.
        (5) In October 27, 2011, testimony before the Committee on 
    Foreign Affairs of the House of Representatives, Secretary of State 
    Hillary Clinton stated that ``we are taking action to target the 
    Haqqani leadership on both sides of the border. We're increasing 
    international efforts to squeeze them operationally and 
    financially. We are already working with the Pakistanis to target 
    those who are behind a lot of the attacks against Afghans and 
    Americans. And I made it very clear to the Pakistanis that the 
    attack on our embassy was an outrage and the attack on our forward 
    operating base that injured 77 of our soldiers was a similar 
    outrage.''.
        (6) At the same hearing, Secretary of State Clinton further 
    stated that ``I think everyone agrees that the Haqqani Network has 
    safe havens inside Pakistan; that those safe havens give them a 
    place to plan and direct operations that kill Afghans and 
    Americans.''.
        (7) On November 1, 2011, the United States Government added 
    Haji Mali Kahn to a list of specially designated global terrorists 
    under Executive Order 13224. The Department of State described Khan 
    as ``a Haqqani Network commander'' who has ``overseen hundreds of 
    fighters, and has instructed his subordinates to conduct terrorist 
    acts.'' The designation continued, ``Mali Khan has provided support 
    and logistics to the Haqqani Network, and has been involved in the 
    planning and execution of attacks in Afghanistan against civilians, 
    coalition forces, and Afghan police''. According to Jason Blazakis, 
    the chief of the Terrorist Designations Unit of the Department of 
    State, Khan also has links to al-Qaeda.
        (8) Five other top Haqqani Network leaders have been placed on 
    the list of specially designated global terrorists under Executive 
    Order 13224 since 2008, and three of them have been so placed in 
    the last year. Sirajuddin Haqqani, the overall leader of the 
    Haqqani Network as well as the leader of the Taliban's Mira shah 
    Regional Military Shura, was designated by the Secretary of State 
    as a terrorist in March 2008, and in March 2009, the Secretary of 
    State put out a bounty of $5,000,000 for information leading to his 
    capture. The other four individuals so designated are Nasiruddin 
    Haqqani, Khalil al Rahman Haqqani, Badruddin Haqqani, and Mullah 
    Sangeen Zadran.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--
        (1) the Haqqani Network meets the criteria for designation as a 
    foreign terrorist organization as set forth in section 219 of the 
    Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
        (2) the Secretary of State should so designate the Haqqani 
    Network as a foreign terrorist organization under such section 219.
    (c) Report.--
        (1) Report required.--Not later than 30 days after the date of 
    the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall submit to 
    the appropriate committees of Congress--
            (A) a detailed report on whether the Haqqani Network meets 
        the criteria for designation as a foreign terrorist 
        organization as set forth in section 219 of the Immigration and 
        Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. 1189); and
            (B) if the Secretary determines that the Haqqani Network 
        does not meet the criteria set forth under such section 219, a 
        detailed justification as to which criteria have not been met.
        (2) Form.--The report required by paragraph (1) shall be 
    submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified annex.
        (3) Appropriate committees of congress defined.--In this 
    subsection, the term ``appropriate committees of Congress'' means--
            (A) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
        Foreign Relations, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the 
        Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate; and
            (B) the Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on 
        Foreign Affairs, the Committee on the Judiciary, and the 
        Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the House of 
        Representatives.
    (d) Construction.--Nothing in this Act may be construed to infringe 
upon the sovereignty of Pakistan to combat militant or terrorist groups 
operating inside the boundaries of Pakistan.

 To amend the Tariff Act of 1930 to clarify the definition of aircraft

                under that Act, and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the

SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.

    This Act may cited as the ``Ultralight Aircraft Smuggling

SEC. 2. CLARIFICATION OF DEFINITION OF AIRCRAFT AND OFFENSES UNDER 
              AVIATION SMUGGLING PROVISIONS OF THE TARIFF ACT OF 1930.

    (a) In General.--Section 590 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 
1590) is amended--
            (1) by redesignating subsection (g) as subsection (h); and
            (2) by inserting after subsection (f) the following:
    ``(g) Definition of Aircraft.--In this section, the term 
`aircraft'--
            ``(1) has the meaning given that term in section 40102 of 
        title 49, United States Code; and
            ``(2) includes a vehicle described in section 103.1 of 
        title 14, Code of Federal Regulations.''.
    (b) Criminal Penalties.--Subsection (d) of section 590 of the 
Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1590(d)) is amended in the matter 
preceding paragraph (1) by inserting ``, or attempts or conspires to

    (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section apply with 
respect to violations of any provision of section 590 of the Tariff Act 
of 1930 on or after the 30th day after the date of the enactment of 
this Act.

SEC. 3. INTERAGENCY COLLABORATION.

    (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:
            (1) The Department of Defense has worked collaboratively 
        with the Department of Homeland Security to identify equipment, 
        technology, and expertise used by the Department of Defense 
        that could be leveraged by the Department of Homeland Security 
        to help fulfill its missions.
            (2) As part of that collaborative effort, the Department of 
        Homeland Security has leveraged Department of Defense 
        equipment, technology, and expertise to enhance the ability of 
        U.S. Customs and Border Protection to detect, track, and engage 
        illicit trafficking across the international borders between 
        the United States and Mexico and the United States and Canada.
            (3) Leveraging Department of Defense equipment, technology, 
        and expertise is a cost-effective inter-agency approach to 
        enhancing the effectiveness of the Department of Homeland 
        Security to protect the United States against a variety of 
        threats and risks.
    (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
Secretary of Defense should--
            (1) continue the broad program of cooperation and 
        collaboration with the Secretary of Homeland Security described 
        in subsection (a); and
            (2) ensure that the Department of Homeland Security is able 
        to identify equipment and technology used by the Department of 
        Defense that could also be used by U.S. Customs and Border 
        Protection to enhance its efforts to combat illicit trafficking 
        across the international borders between the United States and 
        Mexico and the United States and Canada, including equipment 
        and technology that could be used to detect and track the 
        illicit use of ultralight aircraft.

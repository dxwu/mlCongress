                joint inventor or another who obtained the subject 
                matter disclosed directly or indirectly from the

matter disclosed and a claimed invention shall be deemed to have been

        the joint research agreement.

is prior art to a claimed invention under subsection (a)(2), such 
patent or application shall be considered to have been effectively 
filed, with respect to any subject matter described in the patent or 
application--

        filing date of the patent or the application for patent; or

        applications for patent, as of the filing date of the earliest 
        such application that describes the subject matter.''.

        enactment of section 102(c) of title 35, United States Code, 
        under the preceding paragraph is done with the same intent to 
        promote joint research activities that was expressed, including 
        in the legislative history, through the enactment of the 
        Cooperative Research and Technology Enhancement Act of 2004 
        (Public Law 108-453; the ``CREATE Act''), the amendments of 
        which are stricken by subsection (c). The United States Patent 
        and Trademark Office shall administer section 102(c) of title

        legislative history of the CREATE Act that was relevant to its 
        administration by the United States Patent and Trademark 
        Office.

invention and the prior art are such that the claimed invention as a 
whole would have been obvious before the effective filing date of the

the manner in which the invention was made.''.

invention and has an earlier effective filing date if the invention 
claimed in such other patent was derived from the inventor of the 
invention claimed in the patent owned by the person seeking relief 
under this section.
    ``(b) Filing Limitation.--An action under this section may only be 
filed within 1 year after the issuance of the first patent containing a 
claim to the allegedly derived invention and naming an individual 
alleged to have derived such invention as the inventor or joint 
inventor.''.
    (i) Derivation Proceedings.--Section 135 of title 35, United States 
Code, is amended to read as follows:
``Sec. 135. Derivation proceedings
    ``(a) Institution of Proceeding.--An applicant for patent may file 
a petition to institute a derivation proceeding in the Office. The 
petition shall set forth with particularity the basis for finding that 
an inventor named in an earlier application derived the claimed 
invention from an inventor named in the petitioner's application and, 
without authorization, the earlier application claiming such invention 
was filed. Any such petition may only be filed within 1 year after the 
first publication of a claim to an invention that is the same or 
substantially the same as the earlier application's claim to the 
invention, shall be made under oath, and shall be supported by 
substantial evidence. Whenever the Director determines that a petition 
filed under this subsection demonstrates that the standards for 
instituting a derivation proceeding are met, the Director may institute 
a derivation proceeding. The determination by the Director whether to 
institute a derivation proceeding shall be final and nonappealable.
    ``(b) Determination by Patent Trial and Appeal Board.--In a 
derivation proceeding instituted under subsection (a), the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board shall determine whether an inventor named in the 
earlier application derived the claimed invention from an inventor 
named in the petitioner's application and, without authorization, the 
earlier application claiming such invention was filed. The Director 
shall prescribe regulations setting forth standards for the conduct of 
derivation proceedings.
    ``(c) Deferral of Decision.--The Patent Trial and Appeal Board may 
defer action on a petition for a derivation proceeding until 3 months 
after the date on which the Director issues a patent that includes the 
claimed invention that is the subject of the petition. The Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board also may defer action on a petition for a derivation 
proceeding, or stay the proceeding after it has been instituted, until 
the termination of a proceeding under chapter 30, 31, or 32 involving 
the patent of the earlier applicant.
    ``(d) Effect of Final Decision.--The final decision of the Patent 
Trial and Appeal Board, if adverse to claims in an application for 
patent, shall constitute the final refusal by the Office on those 
claims. The final decision of the Patent Trial and Appeal Board, if 
adverse to claims in a patent, shall, if no appeal or other review of 
the decision has been or can be taken or had, constitute cancellation 
of those claims, and notice of such cancellation shall be endorsed on 
copies of the patent distributed after such cancellation.
    ``(e) Settlement.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under 
subsection (a) may terminate the proceeding by filing a written 
statement reflecting the agreement of the parties as to the correct 
inventors of the claimed invention in dispute. Unless the Patent Trial 
and Appeal Board finds the agreement to be inconsistent with the 
evidence of record, if any, it shall take action consistent with the 
agreement. Any written settlement or understanding of the parties shall 
be filed with the Director. At the request of a party to the 
proceeding, the agreement or understanding shall be treated as business 
confidential information, shall be kept separate from the file of the 
involved patents or applications, and shall be made available only to 
Government agencies on written request, or to any person on a showing 
of good cause.
    ``(f) Arbitration.--Parties to a proceeding instituted under 
subsection (a) may, within such time as may be specified by the 
Director by regulation, determine such contest or any aspect thereof by 
arbitration. Such arbitration shall be governed by the provisions of 
title 9, to the extent such title is not inconsistent with this 
section. The parties shall give notice of any arbitration award to the 
Director, and such award shall, as between the parties to the 
arbitration, be dispositive of the issues to which it relates. The 
arbitration award shall be unenforceable until such notice is given. 
Nothing in this subsection shall preclude the Director from determining 
the patentability of the claimed inventions involved in the 
proceeding.''.
    (j) Elimination of References to Interferences.--(1) Sections 41, 
134, 145, 146, 154, 305, and 314 of title 35, United States Code, are

                    (A) In general.--The Chief Counsel, in consultation 
                with the General Counsel, shall conduct a study of the 
                effects of eliminating the use of dates of invention in 
                determining whether an applicant is entitled to a 
                patent under title 35, United States Code.
                    (B) Areas of study.--The study conducted under 
                subparagraph (A) shall include examination of the 
                effects of eliminating the use of invention dates, 
                including examining--
                            (i) how the change would affect the ability 
                        of small business concerns to obtain patents 
                        and their costs of obtaining patents;
                            (ii) whether the change would create, 
                        mitigate, or exacerbate any disadvantage for 
                        applicants for patents that are small business 
                        concerns relative to applicants for patents 
                        that are not small business concerns, and 
                        whether the change would create any advantages 
                        for applicants for patents that are small 
                        business concerns relative to applicants for 
                        patents that are not small business concerns;
                            (iii) the cost savings and other potential 
                        benefits to small business concerns of the 
                        change; and
                            (iv) the feasibility and costs and benefits 
                        to small business concerns of alternative means 
                        of determining whether an applicant is entitled

        recommendations of the Director on the operation of prior user 
        rights in selected countries in the industrialized world. The 
        report shall include the following:
                    (A) A comparison between patent laws of the United

                    (C) An analysis of the correlation, if any, between 
                prior user rights and start-up enterprises and the 
                ability to attract venture capital to start new 
                companies.
                    (D) An analysis of the effect of prior user rights, 
                if any, on small businesses, universities, and 
                individual inventors.
                    (E) An analysis of legal and constitutional issues,

                patent law.
                    (F) An analysis of whether the change to a first-
                to-file patent system creates a particular need for 
                prior user rights.
            (2) Consultation with other agencies.--In preparing the 
        report required under paragraph (1), the Director shall consult

        in a proceeding before the International Trade Commission that 
        a claim in a patent is invalid on any ground that the

should be instituted based upon the failure of the petition to meet any 
requirement of this chapter.
``Sec. 324. Institution of post-grant review
    ``(a) Threshold.--The Director may not authorize a post-grant 
review to commence unless the Director determines that the information

demonstrate that it is more likely than not that at least 1 of the 
claims challenged in the petition is unpatentable.
    ``(b) Additional Grounds.--The determination required under 
subsection (a) may also be satisfied by a showing that the petition 
raises a novel or unsettled legal question that is important to other 
patents or patent applications.

post-grant review under this chapter within 3 months after receiving a 
preliminary response under section 323 or, if none is filed, the

owner, in writing, of the Director's determination under subsection (a) 
or (b), and shall make such notice available to the public as soon as

of a post-grant review available to the public. Such notice shall list 
the date on which the review shall commence.

instituted or maintained if the petitioner or real party in interest 
has filed a civil action challenging the validity of a claim of the 
patent.

infringement of a patent is filed within 3 months of the grant of the 
patent, the court may not stay its consideration of the patent owner's 
motion for a preliminary injunction against infringement of the patent 
on the basis that a petition for post-grant review has been filed or 
that such a proceeding has been instituted.
    ``(c) Joinder.--If more than 1 petition for a post-grant review is 
properly filed against the same patent and the Director determines that 
more than 1 of these petitions warrants the institution of a post-grant 
review under section 324, the Director may consolidate such reviews 
into a single post-grant review.
    ``(d) Multiple Proceedings.--Notwithstanding sections 135(a), 251, 
and 252, and chapter 30, during the pendency of any post-grant review, 
if another proceeding or matter involving the patent is before the 
Office, the Director may determine the manner in which the post-grant 
review or other proceeding or matter may proceed, including providing 
for stay, transfer, consolidation, or termination of any such matter or 
proceeding. In determining whether to institute or order a proceeding 
under this chapter, chapter 30, or chapter 31, the Director may take 
into account whether, and reject the petition or request because, the 
same or substantially the same prior art or arguments previously were 
presented to the Office.
    ``(e) Estoppel.--
            ``(1) Proceedings before the office.--The petitioner in a 
        post-grant review under this chapter, or his real party in

        before the Office with respect to a claim on any ground that 
        the petitioner raised or reasonably could have raised during a 
        post-grant review of the claim that resulted in a final written 
        decision under section 328(a).
            ``(2) Civil actions and other proceedings.--The petitioner 
        in a post-grant review under this chapter, or his real party in 
        interest or privy, may not assert either in a civil action 
        arising in whole or in part under section 1338 of title 28 or 
        in a proceeding before the International Trade Commission that 
        a claim in a patent is invalid on any ground that the 
        petitioner raised during a post-grant review of the claim that 
        resulted in a final written decision under section 328(a).
    ``(f) Reissue Patents.--A post-grant review may not be instituted 
if the petition requests cancellation of a claim in a reissue patent 
that is identical to or narrower than a claim in the original patent 
from which the reissue patent was issued, and the time limitations in 
section 321(c) would bar filing a petition for a post-grant review for 
such original patent.

        submitted by the patent owner in support of any amendment 
        entered under subsection (d) is made available to the public as 
        part of the prosecution history of the patent;

        be permitted upon the joint request of the petitioner and the 
        patent owner to materially advance the settlement of a 
        proceeding under section 327, or upon the request of the patent 
        owner for good cause shown.
            ``(3) Scope of claims.--An amendment under this subsection

chapter shall be terminated with respect to any petitioner upon the 
joint request of the petitioner and the patent owner, unless the Office 
has decided the merits of the proceeding before the request for 
termination is filed. If the post-grant review is terminated with 
respect to a petitioner under this section, no estoppel under section 
325(e) shall apply to that petitioner. If no petitioner remains in the 
post-grant review, the Office may terminate the post-grant review or

between the patent owner and a petitioner, including any collateral 
agreements referred to in such agreement or understanding, made in 
connection with, or in contemplation of, the termination of a post-
grant review under this section shall be in writing, and a true copy of 
such agreement or understanding shall be filed in the Office before the 
termination of the post-grant review as between the parties. If any 
party filing such agreement or understanding so requests, the copy 
shall be kept separate from the file of the post-grant review, and 
shall be made available only to Federal Government agencies upon 
written request, or to any other person on a showing of good cause.

        prejudice to the filing of a petition for a post-grant review 
        under chapter 32 of title 35, United States Code, or is to 
        proceed as if this Act had not been enacted. The Director shall

subsection (c), shall not be considered by the Office for any purpose 
other than to determine the proper meaning of a patent claim in a 
proceeding that is ordered or instituted pursuant to section 304, 314, 
or 324. If any such written statement or additional information is 
subject to an applicable protective order, it shall be redacted to 
exclude information that is subject to that order.

citing prior art or written statements pursuant to subsection (a), that 
person's identity shall be excluded from the patent file and kept 
confidential.''.

        shall take effect 1 year after the date of the enactment of 
        this Act and shall apply to patents issued before, on, or after 
        that effective date.

                paragraph shall take effect 1 year after the date of

                    (D) whether a stay, or the denial thereof, will

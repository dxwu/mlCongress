    shall be adjusted by the Secretary by notice, published in the 
    Federal Register, for a fiscal year by the amount equal to the sum

        than personnel compensation and benefits costs to total costs 
        of the process for the review of human drug applications (as 
        defined in section 735(6)) for the first 3 years of the 
        preceding 4 fiscal years.
    The adjustment made each fiscal year under this paragraph shall be 
    added on a compounded basis to the sum of all adjustments made each 
    fiscal year after fiscal year 2013 under this paragraph.

    fiscal years, after the fee revenues established in subsection (b) 
    are adjusted for a fiscal year for inflation in accordance with 
    paragraph (1), the fee revenues shall be adjusted further for such 
    fiscal year to reflect changes in the workload of the Secretary for 
    the process for the review of human drug applications. With respect 
    to such adjustment:
            ``(A) The adjustment shall be determined by the Secretary 
        based on a weighted average of the change in the total number 
        of human drug applications (adjusted for changes in review 
        activities, as described in the notice that the Secretary is 
        required to publish in the Federal Register under this 
        subparagraph), efficacy supplements, and manufacturing 
        supplements submitted to the Secretary, and the change in the 
        total number of active commercial investigational new drug 
        applications (adjusted for changes in review activities, as so 
        described) during the most recent 12-month period for which 
        data on such submissions is available. The Secretary shall 
        publish in the Federal Register the fee revenues and fees 
        resulting from the adjustment and the supporting methodologies.

        the amount under subsection (b)(1)(A) and the amount under 
        subsection (b)(1)(B), as adjusted for inflation under paragraph 
        (1).
            ``(C) The Secretary shall contract with an independent 
        accounting or consulting firm to periodically review the 
        adequacy of the adjustment and publish the results of those 
        reviews. The first review shall be conducted and published by 
        the end of fiscal year 2013 (to examine the performance of the 
        adjustment since fiscal year 2009), and the second review shall 
        be conducted and published by the end of fiscal year 2015 (to 
        examine the continued performance of the adjustment). The 
        reports shall evaluate whether the adjustment reasonably 
        represents actual changes in workload volume and complexity and 
        present options to discontinue, retain, or modify any elements 
        of the adjustment. The reports shall be published for public 
        comment. After review of the reports and receipt of public 
        comments, the Secretary shall, if warranted, adopt appropriate 
        changes to the methodology. If the Secretary adopts changes to 
        the methodology based on the first report, the changes shall be 
        effective for the first fiscal year for which fees are set 
        after the Secretary adopts such changes and each subsequent 
        fiscal year.
        ``(3) Final year adjustment.--For fiscal year 2017, the 
    Secretary may, in addition to adjustments under this paragraph and 
    paragraphs (1) and (2), further increase the fee revenues and fees 
    established in subsection (b) if such an adjustment is necessary to 
    provide for not more than 3 months of operating reserves of 
    carryover user fees for the process for the review of human drug 
    applications for the first 3 months of fiscal year 2018. If such an 
    adjustment is necessary, the rationale for the amount of the 
    increase shall be contained in the annual notice establishing fee 
    revenues and fees for fiscal year 2017. If the Secretary has 
    carryover balances for such process in excess of 3 months of such 
    operating reserves, the adjustment under this paragraph shall not 
    be made.
        ``(4) Annual fee setting.--The Secretary shall, not later than 
    60 days before the start of each fiscal year that begins after 
    September 30, 2012, establish, for the next fiscal year, 
    application, product, and establishment fees under subsection (a), 
    based on the revenue amounts established under subsection (b) and 
    the adjustments provided under this subsection.
        ``(5) Limit.--The total amount of fees charged, as adjusted

        after fiscal year 2012 to defray the costs of the process for 
        the review of biosimilar biological product applications 
        (including such costs for an additional number of full-time 
        equivalent positions in the Department of Health and Human

does not receive payment of a fee assessed under subsection (a) within 
30 days after it is due, such fee shall be treated as a claim of the 
United States Government subject to subchapter II of chapter 37 of 
title 31, United States Code.

consideration for a waiver under subsection (c), or for a refund of any 
fee collected in accordance with subsection (a)(2)(A), a person shall 
submit to the Secretary a written request for such waiver or refund not 
later than 180 days after such fee is due.

biological product applications, be reduced to offset the number of

    clinical investigations which the Secretary believes may be 
    necessary to be conducted with the drug before such drug may be 
    approved under section 505 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
    Act (21 U.S.C. 355) for use in treating, detecting, preventing, or 
    identifying a qualifying pathogen, as defined in section 505E of 
    such Act.
        (2) Recommendations.--If the Secretary has reason to believe 
    that a drug for which a request is made under this subsection is a 
    qualified infectious disease product, the Secretary shall provide 
    the person making the request written recommendations for the 
    nonclinical and clinical investigations which the Secretary 
    believes, on the basis of information available to the Secretary at 
    the time of the request, would be necessary for approval under

               TITLE IX--DRUG APPROVAL AND PATIENT ACCESS

    SEC. 901. ENHANCEMENT OF ACCELERATED PATIENT ACCESS TO NEW MEDICAL 
      TREATMENTS.
    (a) Findings; Sense of Congress.--
        (1) Findings.--Congress finds as follows:
            (A) The Food and Drug Administration (referred to in this 
        section as the ``FDA'') serves a critical role in helping to 
        assure that new medicines are safe and effective. Regulatory 
        innovation is 1 element of the Nation's strategy to address 
        serious and life-threatening diseases or conditions by 
        promoting investment in and development of innovative 
        treatments for unmet medical needs.
            (B) During the 2 decades following the establishment of the 
        accelerated approval mechanism, advances in medical sciences, 
        including genomics, molecular biology, and bioinformatics, have 
        provided an unprecedented understanding of the underlying 
        biological mechanism and pathogenesis of disease. A new 
        generation of modern, targeted medicines is under development 
        to treat serious and life-threatening diseases, some applying 
        drug development strategies based on biomarkers or 
        pharmacogenomics, predictive toxicology, clinical trial 
        enrichment techniques, and novel clinical trial designs, such 
        as adaptive clinical trials.
            (C) As a result of these remarkable scientific and medical 
        advances, the FDA should be encouraged to implement more 
        broadly effective processes for the expedited development and 
        review of innovative new medicines intended to address unmet 
        medical needs for serious or life-threatening diseases or 
        conditions, including those for rare diseases or conditions, 
        using a broad range of surrogate or clinical endpoints and 
        modern scientific tools earlier in the drug development cycle 
        when appropriate. This may result in fewer, smaller, or shorter 
        clinical trials for the intended patient population or targeted 
        subpopulation without compromising or altering the high 
        standards of the FDA for the approval of drugs.
            (D) Patients benefit from expedited access to safe and 
        effective innovative therapies to treat unmet medical needs for 
        serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
            (E) For these reasons, the statutory authority in effect on 
        the day before the date of enactment of this Act governing 
        expedited approval of drugs for serious or life-threatening 
        diseases or conditions should be amended in order to enhance 
        the authority of the FDA to consider appropriate scientific 
        data, methods, and tools, and to expedite development and 
        access to novel treatments for patients with a broad range of 
        serious or life-threatening diseases or conditions.
        (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that the 
    Food and Drug Administration should apply the accelerated approval 
    and fast track provisions set forth in section 506 of the Federal 
    Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 356), as amended by this 
    section, to help expedite the development and availability to 
    patients of treatments for serious or life-threatening diseases or 
    conditions while maintaining safety and effectiveness standards for 
    such treatments.
    (b) Expedited Approval of Drugs for Serious or Life-Threatening 
Diseases or Conditions.--Section 506 (21 U.S.C. 356) is amended to read 
as follows:
    ``SEC. 506. EXPEDITED APPROVAL OF DRUGS FOR SERIOUS OR LIFE-
      THREATENING DISEASES OR CONDITIONS.
    ``(a) Designation of Drug as Fast Track Product.--
        ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall, at the request of the 
    sponsor of a new drug, facilitate the development and expedite the 
    review of such drug if it is intended, whether alone or in 
    combination with one or more other drugs, for the treatment of a 
    serious or life-threatening disease or condition, and it 
    demonstrates the potential to address unmet medical needs for such 
    a disease or condition. (In this section, such a drug is referred 
    to as a `fast track product'.)
        ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a new drug may 
    request the Secretary to designate the drug as a fast track 
    product. A request for the designation may be made concurrently 
    with, or at any time after, submission of an application for the 
    investigation of the drug under section 505(i) or section 351(a)(3) 
    of the Public Health Service Act.
        ``(3) Designation.--Within 60 calendar days after the receipt 
    of a request under paragraph (2), the Secretary shall determine 
    whether the drug that is the subject of the request meets the 
    criteria described in paragraph (1). If the Secretary finds that 
    the drug meets the criteria, the Secretary shall designate the drug 
    as a fast track product and shall take such actions as are 
    appropriate to expedite the development and review of the 
    application for approval of such product.
    ``(b) Accelerated Approval of a Drug for a Serious or Life-
Threatening Disease or Condition, Including a Fast Track Product.--
        ``(1) In general.--
            ``(A) Accelerated approval.--The Secretary may approve an 
        application for approval of a product for a serious or life-
        threatening disease or condition, including a fast track 
        product, under section 505(c) or section 351(a) of the Public 
        Health Service Act upon a determination that the product has an 
        effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to 
        predict clinical benefit, or on a clinical endpoint that can be 
        measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality, that 
        is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible 
        morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit, taking into 
        account the severity, rarity, or prevalence of the condition 
        and the availability or lack of alternative treatments. The 
        approval described in the preceding sentence is referred to in 
        this section as `accelerated approval'.
            ``(B) Evidence.--The evidence to support that an endpoint 
        is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit under 
        subparagraph (A) may include epidemiological, 
        pathophysiological, therapeutic, pharmacologic, or other 
        evidence developed using biomarkers, for example, or other 
        scientific methods or tools.
        ``(2) Limitation.--Approval of a product under this subsection 
    may be subject to 1 or both of the following requirements:
            ``(A) That the sponsor conduct appropriate postapproval 
        studies to verify and describe the predicted effect on 
        irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit.
            ``(B) That the sponsor submit copies of all promotional 
        materials related to the product during the preapproval review 
        period and, following approval and for such period thereafter 
        as the Secretary determines to be appropriate, at least 30 days 
        prior to dissemination of the materials.
        ``(3) Expedited withdrawal of approval.--The Secretary may 
    withdraw approval of a product approved under accelerated approval 
    using expedited procedures (as prescribed by the Secretary in 
    regulations which shall include an opportunity for an informal 
    hearing) if--
            ``(A) the sponsor fails to conduct any required 
        postapproval study of the drug with due diligence;
            ``(B) a study required to verify and describe the predicted 
        effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical 
        benefit of the product fails to verify and describe such effect 
        or benefit;
            ``(C) other evidence demonstrates that the product is not 
        safe or effective under the conditions of use; or
            ``(D) the sponsor disseminates false or misleading 
        promotional materials with respect to the product.
    ``(c) Review of Incomplete Applications for Approval of a Fast 
Track Product.--
        ``(1) In general.--If the Secretary determines, after 
    preliminary evaluation of clinical data submitted by the sponsor, 
    that a fast track product may be effective, the Secretary shall 
    evaluate for filing, and may commence review of portions of, an 
    application for the approval of the product before the sponsor 
    submits a complete application. The Secretary shall commence such 
    review only if the applicant--
            ``(A) provides a schedule for submission of information 
        necessary to make the application complete; and
            ``(B) pays any fee that may be required under section 736.
        ``(2) Exception.--Any time period for review of human drug 
    applications that has been agreed to by the Secretary and that has 
    been set forth in goals identified in letters of the Secretary 
    (relating to the use of fees collected under section 736 to 
    expedite the drug development process and the review of human drug 
    applications) shall not apply to an application submitted under 
    paragraph (1) until the date on which the application is complete.
    ``(d) Awareness Efforts.--The Secretary shall--
        ``(1) develop and disseminate to physicians, patient 
    organizations, pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, and 
    other appropriate persons a description of the provisions of this 
    section applicable to accelerated approval and fast track products; 
    and
        ``(2) establish a program to encourage the development of 
    surrogate and clinical endpoints, including biomarkers, and other 
    scientific methods and tools that can assist the Secretary in 
    determining whether the evidence submitted in an application is 
    reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit for serious or life-
    threatening conditions for which significant unmet medical needs 
    exist.
    ``(e) Construction.--
        ``(1) Purpose.--The amendments made by the Food and Drug 
    Administration Safety and Innovation Act to this section are 
    intended to encourage the Secretary to utilize innovative and 
    flexible approaches to the assessment of products under accelerated 
    approval for treatments for patients with serious or life-
    threatening diseases or conditions and unmet medical needs.
        ``(2) Construction.--Nothing in this section shall be construed 
    to alter the standards of evidence under subsection (c) or (d) of 
    section 505 (including the substantial evidence standard in section 
    505(d)) of this Act or under section 351(a) of the Public Health 
    Service Act. Such sections and standards of evidence apply to the 
    review and approval of products under this section, including 
    whether a product is safe and effective. Nothing in this section 
    alters the ability of the Secretary to rely on evidence that does 
    not come from adequate and well-controlled investigations for the 
    purpose of determining whether an endpoint is reasonably likely to 
    predict clinical benefit as described in subsection (b)(1)(B).''.
    (c) Guidance; Amended Regulations.--
        (1) Draft guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the date of 
    enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Health and Human Services 
    (referred to in this section as the ``Secretary'') shall issue 
    draft guidance to implement the amendments made by this section. In 
    developing such guidance, the Secretary shall specifically consider 
    issues arising under the accelerated approval and fast track 
    processes under section 506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic 
    Act, as amended by subsection (b), for drugs designated for a rare 
    disease or condition under section 526 of such Act (21 U.S.C. 
    360bb) and shall also consider any unique issues associated with 
    very rare diseases.
        (2) Final guidance.--Not later than 1 year after the issuance 
    of draft guidance under paragraph (1), and after an opportunity for 
    public comment, the Secretary shall--
            (A) issue final guidance; and
            (B) amend the regulations governing accelerated approval in 
        parts 314 and 601 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, as 
        necessary to conform such regulations with the amendment made 
        by subsection (b).
        (3) Consideration.--In developing the guidance under paragraphs 
    (1) and (2)(A) and the amendments under paragraph (2)(B), the 
    Secretary shall consider how to incorporate novel approaches to the 
    review of surrogate endpoints based on pathophysiologic and 
    pharmacologic evidence in such guidance, especially in instances 
    where the low prevalence of a disease renders the existence or 
    collection of other types of data unlikely or impractical.
        (4) Conforming changes.--The Secretary shall issue, as 
    necessary, conforming amendments to the applicable regulations 
    under title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, governing accelerated 
    approval.
        (5) No effect of inaction on requests.--The issuance (or 
    nonissuance) of guidance or conforming regulations implementing the 
    amendment made by subsection (b) shall not preclude the review of, 
    or action on, a request for designation or an application for 
    approval submitted pursuant to section 506 of the Federal Food, 
    Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by subsection (b).
    (d) Independent Review.--The Secretary may, in conjunction with 
other planned reviews, contract with an independent entity with 
expertise in assessing the quality and efficiency of biopharmaceutical 
development and regulatory review programs to evaluate the Food and 
Drug Administration's application of the processes described in section 
506 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, as amended by 
subsection (b), and the impact of such processes on the development and 
timely availability of innovative treatments for patients suffering 
from serious or life-threatening conditions. Any such evaluation shall 
include consultation with regulated industries, patient advocacy and 
disease research foundations, and relevant academic medical centers.

    sponsor of a drug, expedite the development and review of such drug 
    if the drug is intended, alone or in combination with 1 or more 
    other drugs, to treat a serious or life-threatening disease or 
    condition and preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug 
    may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies on 
    1 or more clinically significant endpoints, such as substantial 
    treatment effects observed early in clinical development. (In this 
    section, such a drug is referred to as a `breakthrough therapy'.)
        ``(2) Request for designation.--The sponsor of a drug may 
    request the Secretary to designate the drug as a breakthrough 
    therapy. A request for the designation may be made concurrently

    ``(b) Timing.--A notice required under subsection (a) shall be 
submitted to the Secretary--
        ``(1) at least 6 months prior to the date of the discontinuance

        deems necessary to address a shortage of a controlled substance 
        based on the best available market data; and
            ``(C) if the Attorney General determines that the level 
        requested is not necessary to address a shortage of a

        Secretary a written response detailing the basis for the 
        Attorney General's determination.
    The Secretary shall make the written response provided under

        likely to lead to a reduction in the supply of a drug by a 
        manufacturer that is more than negligible and affects the 
        ability of the manufacturer to fill orders or meet expected 
        demand for its product; and

        analogs, if the Secretary determines such inclusion would 
        benefit the public health. Such regulation shall take into 
        account any supply reporting programs and shall aim to reduce 
        duplicative notification.

the Secretary of Health and Human Services (referred to in this title 
as the ``Secretary'') for purposes of complying with the requirement in 
section 506C(a) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as amended

    collection of hospitals that are owned and operated by the same 
    entity and that share access to databases with drug order 
    information for their patients.
        ``(3) Repackage.--For the purposes of this section only, the 
    term `repackage', with respect to a drug, means to divide the 
    volume of a drug into smaller amounts in order to--
            ``(A) extend the supply of a drug in response to the 
        placement of the drug on a drug shortage list under section 
        506E; and
            ``(B) facilitate access to the drug by hospitals within the 
        same health system.
    ``(b) Exclusion From Registration.--Notwithstanding any other 
provision of this Act, a hospital shall not be considered an 
establishment for which registration is required under section 510 
solely because it repackages a drug and transfers it to another 
hospital within the same health system in accordance with the 
conditions in subsection (c)--
        ``(1) during any period in which the drug is listed on the drug 
    shortage list under section 506E; or
        ``(2) during the 60-day period following any period described 
    in paragraph (1).
    ``(c) Conditions.--Subsection (b) shall only apply to a hospital, 
with respect to the repackaging of a drug for transfer to another 
hospital within the same health system, if the following conditions are

SEC. 1008. STUDY ON DRUG SHORTAGES.
    (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States shall 
conduct a study to examine the cause of drug shortages and formulate 
recommendations on how to prevent or alleviate such shortages.
    (b) Consideration.--In conducting the study under this section, the 
Comptroller General shall consider the following questions:
        (1) What are the dominant characteristics of drugs that have 
    gone into a drug shortage over the preceding 3 years?
        (2) Are there systemic high-risk factors (such as drug pricing 
    structure, including Federal reimbursements, or the number of 
    manufacturers producing a drug product) that have led to the 
    concentration of drug shortages in certain drug products that have 
    made such products vulnerable to drug shortages?
        (3) Is there a reason why drug shortages have occurred 
    primarily in the sterile injectable market and in certain 
    therapeutic areas?
        (4)(A) How have regulations, guidance documents, regulatory 
    practices, policies, and other actions of Federal departments and 
    agencies (including the effectiveness of interagency and intra-
    agency coordination, communication, strategic planning, and 
    decisionmaking), including those used to enforce statutory 
    requirements, affected drug shortages?
        (B) Do any such regulations, guidances, policies, or practices 
    cause, exacerbate, prevent, or mitigate drug shortages?
        (C) How can regulations, guidances, policies, or practices be 
    modified, streamlined, expanded, or discontinued in order to reduce 
    or prevent such drug shortages?
        (D) What effect would the changes described in subparagraph (C) 
    have on the public health?
        (5) How does hoarding affect drug shortages?
        (6) How would incentives alleviate or prevent drug shortages?
        (7) To what extent are health care providers, including 
    hospitals and physicians responding to drug shortages, able to 
    adjust care effectively to compensate for such shortages, and what 
    impediments exist that hinder provider ability to adjust to such 
    shortages?
        (8)(A) Have drug shortages led market participants to stockpile 
    affected drugs or sell such drugs at inflated prices?
        (B) What has been the impact of any such activities described 
    in subparagraph (A) on Federal revenue, and are there any economic 
    factors that have exacerbated or created a market for such 
    activities?
        (C) Is there a need for any additional reporting or enforcement 
    actions to address such activities?
        (9)(A) How have the activities under section 506D of the 
    Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (as added by section 1003 of 
    this Act) improved the efforts of the Food and Drug Administration 
    to mitigate and prevent drug shortages?
        (B) Is there a need to continue the task force and strategic 
    plan under such section 506D, or are there any other 
    recommendations to increase communication and coordination inside 
    the Food and Drug Administration, between the Food and Drug 
    Administration and other agencies, and between the Food and Drug 
    Administration and stakeholders?
    (c) Consultation With Stakeholders.--In conducting the study under 
this section, the Comptroller General shall consult with relevant 
stakeholders, including physicians, pharmacists, hospitals, patients, 
drug manufacturers, and other health providers.
    (d) Report.--Not later than 18 months after the date of the 
enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit a report to 
the Committee on Energy and Commerce of the House of Representatives 
and the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions of the 
Senate on the results of the study under this section.

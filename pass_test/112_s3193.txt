                                 An Act


 
 To make technical corrections to the legal description of certain land 
  to be held in trust for the Barona Band of Mission Indians, and for 
                             other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``Barona Band of Mission Indians Land 
Transfer Clarification Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSES.
    (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--
        (1) the legal description of land previously taken into trust 
    by the United States for the benefit of the Barona Band of Mission 
    Indians may be interpreted to refer to private, nontribal land;
        (2) there is a continued, unresolved disagreement between the 
    Barona Band of Mission Indians and certain off-reservation property 
    owners relating to the causes of diminishing native groundwater;
        (3) Congress expresses no opinion, nor should an opinion of 
    Congress be inferred, relating to the disagreement described in 
    paragraph (2); and
        (4) it is the intent of Congress that, if the land described in 
    section 121(b) of the Native American Technical Corrections Act of 
    2004 (118 Stat. 544) (as amended by section 3) is used to bring 
    water to the Barona Indian Reservation, the effort is authorized 
    only if the effort also addresses water availability for 
    neighboring off-reservation land located along Old Barona Road that 
    is occupied as of the date of enactment of this Act by providing 
    guaranteed access to that water supply at a mutually agreeable site 
    on the southwest boundary of the Barona Indian Reservation.
    (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--
        (1) to clarify the legal description of the land placed into 
    trust for the Barona Band of Mission Indians in 2004; and
        (2) to remove all doubt relating to the specific parcels of 
    land that Congress has placed into trust for the Barona Band of 
    Mission Indians.
SEC. 3. LAND TRANSFER.
    Section 121 of the Native American Technical Corrections Act of

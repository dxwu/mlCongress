treated as a design application under chapter 16.
    ``(b) Review.--An applicant may request review by the Director of 
the filing date of the international design application in the United 
States. The Director may determine that the filing date of the 
international design application in the United States is a date other 
than the effective registration date. The Director may establish 
procedures, including the payment of a surcharge, to review the filing 
date under this section. Such review may result in a determination that 
the application has a filing date in the United States other than the 
effective registration date.
``Sec. 385. Effect of international design application
    ``An international design application designating the United States 
shall have the effect, for all purposes, from its filing date 
determined in accordance with section 384, of an application for patent 
filed in the Patent and Trademark Office pursuant to chapter 16.
``Sec. 386. Right of priority
    ``(a) National Application.--In accordance with the conditions and

172, a national application shall be entitled to the right of priority 
based on a prior international design application that designated at 
least 1 country other than the United States.
    ``(b) Prior Foreign Application.--In accordance with the conditions 
and requirements of subsections (a) through (d) of section 119 and 
section 172 and the treaty and the Regulations, an international design 
application designating the United States shall be entitled to the 
right of priority based on a prior foreign application, a prior 
international application as defined in section 351(c) designating at 
least 1 country other than the United States, or a prior international 
design application designating at least 1 country other than the United 
States.
    ``(c) Prior National Application.--In accordance with the 
conditions and requirements of section 120, an international design 
application designating the United States shall be entitled to the 
benefit of the filing date of a prior national application, a prior 
international application as defined in section 351(c) designating the 
United States, or a prior international design application designating 
the United States, and a national application shall be entitled to the 
benefit of the filing date of a prior international design application 
designating the United States. If any claim for the benefit of an 
earlier filing date is based on a prior international application as 
defined in section 351(c) which designated but did not originate in the 
United States or a prior international design application which 
designated but did not originate in the United States, the Director may 
require the filing in the Patent and Trademark Office of a certified 
copy of such application together with a translation thereof into the 
English language, if it was filed in another language.
``Sec. 387. Relief from prescribed time limits
    ``An applicant's failure to act within prescribed time limits in 
connection with requirements pertaining to an international design 
application may be excused as to the United States upon a showing 
satisfactory to the Director of unintentional delay and under such 
conditions, including a requirement for payment of the fee specified in 
section 41(a)(7), as may be prescribed by the Director.
``Sec. 388. Withdrawn or abandoned international design application
    ``Subject to sections 384 and 387, if an international design 
application designating the United States is withdrawn, renounced or 
canceled or considered withdrawn or abandoned, either generally or as 
to the United States, under the conditions of the treaty and the 
Regulations, the designation of the United States shall have no effect 
after the date of withdrawal, renunciation, cancellation, or 
abandonment and shall be considered as not having been made, unless a 
claim for benefit of a prior filing date under section 386(c) was made 
in a national application, or an international design application 
designating the United States, or a claim for benefit under section 
365(c) was made in an international application designating the United 
States, filed before the date of such withdrawal, renunciation, 
cancellation, or abandonment. However, such withdrawn, renounced, 
canceled, or abandoned international design application may serve as 
the basis for a claim of priority under subsections (a) and (b) of 
section 386, or under subsection (a) or (b) of section 365, if it 
designated a country other than the United States.
``Sec. 389. Examination of international design application
    ``(a) In General.--The Director shall cause an examination to be 
made pursuant to this title of an international design application 
designating the United States.
    ``(b) Applicability of Chapter 16.--All questions of substance and, 
unless otherwise required by the treaty and Regulations, procedures 
regarding an international design application designating the United 
States shall be determined as in the case of applications filed under 
chapter 16.

international design applications, for designating the United States, 
and for any other processing, services, or materials relating to 
international design applications, and may provide for later payment of 
such fees, including surcharges for later submission of fees.
    ``(d) Issuance of Patent.--The Director may issue a patent based on 
an international design application designating the United States, in 
accordance with the provisions of this title. Such patent shall have 
the force and effect of a patent issued on an application filed under 
chapter 16.
``Sec. 390. Publication of international design application
    ``The publication under the treaty of an international design 
application designating the United States shall be deemed a publication 
under section 122(b).''.

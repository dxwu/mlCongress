                                 An Act


 
       To authorize the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security 
      (Transportation Security Administration) to modify screening 
 requirements for checked baggage arriving from preclearance airports, 
                         and for other purposes.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,
SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.
    This Act may be cited as the ``No-Hassle Flying Act of 2012''.
SEC. 2. PRECLEARANCE AIRPORTS.
    (a) In General.--Section 44901(d) of title 49, United States Code, 
is amended by adding at the end the following new paragraph:
        ``(4) Preclearance airports.--
            ``(A) In general.--For a flight or flight segment 
        originating at an airport outside the United States and 
        traveling to the United States with respect to which checked 
        baggage has been screened in accordance with an aviation 
        security preclearance agreement between the United States and 
        the country in which such airport is located, the Assistant 
        Secretary (Transportation Security Administration) may, in 
        coordination with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, determine 
        whether such baggage must be re-screened in the United States 
        by an explosives detection system before such baggage continues 
        on any additional flight or flight segment.
            ``(B) Aviation security preclearance agreement defined.--In 
        this paragraph, the term `aviation security preclearance 
        agreement' means an agreement that delineates and implements 
        security standards and protocols that are determined by the 
        Assistant Secretary, in coordination with U.S. Customs and 
        Border Protection, to be comparable to those of the United 
        States and therefore sufficiently effective to enable 
        passengers to deplane into sterile areas of airports in the 
        United States.
            ``(C) Report.--The Assistant Secretary shall submit to the 
        Committee on Homeland Security of the House of Representatives, 
        the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the 
        Senate, and the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental 
        Affairs of the Senate an annual report on the re-screening of 
        baggage under this paragraph. Each such report shall include 
        the following for the year covered by the report:
                ``(i) A list of airports outside the United States from 
            which a flight or flight segment traveled to the United 
            States for which the Assistant Secretary determined, in 
            accordance with the authority under subparagraph (A), that 
            checked baggage was not required to be re-screened in the 
            United States by an explosive detection system before such 
            baggage continued on an additional flight or flight 
            segment.
                ``(ii) The amount of Federal savings generated from the 
            exercise of such authority.''.
    (b) Conforming Amendments.--Section 44901 of title 49, United 
States Code, is amended by striking ``explosive'' each place it appears 
and inserting ``explosives''.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.

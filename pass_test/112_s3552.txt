----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the

  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(4) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time. In
  the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any subsequent
  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The

  application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the proposed
  labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee and
  decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of
  an antimicrobial product where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, then review of
  the data for such clearance of such product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance
  action for two years from the effective date of the rule.
(4) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.
(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) All requests for new uses (food and/or nonfood) contained in any application for a new active ingredient or
  a first food use are covered by the base fee for that new active ingredient or first food use application and
  retain the same decision time review period as the new active ingredient or first food use application. The
  application must be received by the agency in one package. The base fee for the category covers a maximum of
  five new products. Each application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval that is
  submitted in the new active ingredient application package or first food use application package is subject to
  the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval. All such associated applications that
  are submitted together will be subject to the new active ingredient or first food use decision review time,
  except where the new inert approval decision review time is greater than that for the new active ingredient,
  in which case the associated new active ingredient will be subject to the new inert approval decision review
  time. In the case of a new active ingredient application, until that new active ingredient is approved, any
  subsequent application for another new product containing the same active ingredient or an amendment to the
  proposed labeling will be deemed a new active ingredient application, subject to the registration service fee
  and decision review time for a new active ingredient. In the case of a first food use application, until that
  first food use is approved, any subsequent application for an additional new food use or uses will be subject
  to the registration service fee and decision review time for a first food use. Any information that (a) was
  neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the applicant at the applicant's
  initiative to support the application after completion of the technical deficiency screening, and (c) is not
  itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full registration service fee for the
  new active ingredient or first food use application.
(3) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(4) (a) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged registration service fees. (b) Registrant-initiated fast-
  track amendments are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(c)(3)(B) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (c) Registrant-initiated fast-track amendments handled by the
  Antimicrobials Division are to be completed within the timelines specified in FIFRA Section 3(h) and are not
  subject to registration service fees. (d) Registrant initiated amendments submitted by notification under PR
  Notices, such as PR Notice 98-10, continue under PR Notice timelines and are not subject to registration
  service fees. (e) Submissions with data and requiring data review are subject to registration service fees.
(5) Amendment applications to add the new use(s) to registered product labels are covered by the base fee for
  the new use(s). All items in the covered application must be submitted together in one package. Each
  application for an additional new product registration and new inert approval(s) that is submitted in the new
  use application package is subject to the registration service fee for a new product or a new inert approval.
  However, if a new use application only proposes to register the new use for a new product and there are no
  amendments in the application, then review of one new product application is covered by the new use fee. All
  such associated applications that are submitted together will be subject to the new use decision review time.
  Any application for a new product or an amendment to the proposed labeling (a) submitted subsequent to
  submission of the new use application and (b) prior to conclusion of its decision review time and (c)
  containing the same new uses, will be deemed a separate new-use application, subject to a separate
  registration service fee and new decision review time for a new use. If the new-use application includes non-
  food (indoor and/or outdoor), and food (outdoor and/or indoor) uses, the appropriate fee is due for each type
  of new use and the longest decision review time applies to all of the new uses requested in the application.
  Any information that (a) was neither requested nor required by the Agency, and (b) is submitted by the
  applicant at the applicant's initiative to support the application after completion of the technical
  deficiency screen, and (c) is not itself a covered registration application, must be assessed 25% of the full
  registration service fee for the new use application.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) New PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that has not been registered.
(3) Registered PIP = a PIP with an active ingredient that is currently registered.
(4) Transfer registered PIP through conventional breeding for new food/feed use, such as from field corn to
  sweet corn.
(5) The scientific data involved in this category are complex. EPA often seeks technical advice from the
  Scientific Advisory Panel on risks that pesticides pose to wildlife, farm workers, pesticide applicators, non-
  target species, as well as insect resistance, and novel scientific issues surrounding new technologies. The
  scientists of the SAP neither make nor recommend policy decisions. They provide advice on the science used to
  make these decisions. Their advice is invaluable to the EPA as it strives to protect humans and the
  environment from risks posed by pesticides. Due to the time it takes to schedule and prepare for meetings with
  the SAP, additional time and costs are needed.
(6) Registered PIPs stacked through conventional breeding.
(7) Deployment of a registered PIP with a different IRM plan (e.g., seed blend).
(8) The negotiated acreage cap will depend upon EPA's determination of the potential environmental exposure,
  risk(s) to non-target organisms, and the risk of targeted pest developing resistance to the pesticidal
  substance. The uncertainty of these risks may reduce the allowable acreage, based upon the quantity and type
  of non-target organism data submitted and the lack of insect resistance management data, which is usually not
  required for seed-increase registrations. Registrants are encouraged to consult with EPA prior to submission
  of a registration application in this category.
(9) Application can be submitted prior to or concurrently with an application for commercial registration.
(10) For example, IRM plan modifications that are applicant-initiated.
(11) EPA-initiated amendments shall not be charged fees.

(1) A decision review time that would otherwise end on a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday, will be extended
  to end on the next business day.
(2) If another covered application is associated with and dependent upon a pending application for an inert
  ingredient action, each application will be subject to its respective registration service fee. The decision
  review time for the other associated covered application will be extended to match the PRIA due date of the
  pending inert ingredient action, unless the PRIA due date for the other associated covered action is further
  out, in which case it will be subject to its own decision review time. If the application covers multiple
  ingredients grouped by EPA into one chemical class, a single registration service fee will be assessed for
  approval of those ingredients.
(3) If EPA data rules are amended to newly require clearance under section 408 of the FFDCA for an ingredient of
  an antimicrobial product where such ingredient was not previously subject to such a clearance, then review of
  the data for such clearance of such product is not subject to a registration service fee for the tolerance
  action for two years from the effective date of the rule.
(4) Any other covered application that is associated with and dependent on the HSRB review will be subject to
  its separate registration service fee. The decision review times for the associated actions run concurrently,
  but will end at the date of the latest review time.
(5) Any other covered application that is associated with and dependent on the SAP review will be subject to its
  separate registration service fee. The decision review time for the associated action will be extended by the
  decision review time for the SAP review.
(6) An application for a new end-use product using a source of active ingredient that (a) is not yet registered
  but (b) has an application pending with the Agency for review, will be considered an application for a new
  product with an unregistered source of active ingredient.
(7) Where the action involves approval of a new or amended label, on or before the end date of the decision
  review time, the Agency shall provide to the applicant a draft accepted label, including any changes made by
  the Agency that differ from the applicant-submitted label and relevant supporting data reviewed by the Agency.
  The applicant will notify the Agency that the applicant either (a) agrees to all of the terms associated with
  the draft accepted label as amended by the Agency and requests that it be issued as the accepted final Agency-
  stamped label; or (b) does not agree to one or more of the terms of the draft accepted label as amended by the
  Agency and requests additional time to resolve the difference(s); or (c) withdraws the application without
  prejudice for subsequent resubmission, but forfeits the associated registration service fee. For cases
  described in (b), the applicant shall have up to 30 calendar days to reach agreement with the Agency on the
  final terms of the Agency-accepted label. If the applicant agrees to all of the terms of the accepted label as
  in (a), including upon resolution of differences in (b), the Agency shall provide an accepted final Agency-
  stamped label to the registrant within 2 business days following the registrant's written or electronic
  confirmation of agreement to the Agency.'';

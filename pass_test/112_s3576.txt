                has been allowed to leave Pakistan alive.
    (f) Expedited Consideration of Presidential Request.--
            (1) In general.--For purposes of this subsection, the term 
        ``joint resolution'' means only a joint resolution introduced 
        in the period beginning on the date on which a request under 
        subsection (e) is received by Congress and ending 60 days 
        thereafter (excluding days either House of Congress is 
        adjourned for more than 3 days during a session of Congress), 
        the matter after the resolving clause of which is as follows: 
        ``That Congress approves the request submitted by the President 
        to suspend the prohibition on foreign assistance to the 
        Government of __ in effect since __, and such prohibition shall 
        have no force or effect.''(The blank spaces being appropriately 
        filled in).
            (2) Referral.--A joint resolution described in paragraph 
        (1) shall be referred to the committees in each House of 
        Congress with jurisdiction.
            (3) Submission date defined.--For purposes of this section, 
        the term ``submission date'' means the date on which a House of 
        Congress receives the request submitted under subsection (e).
            (4) Discharge of senate committee.--In the Senate, if the 
        committee to which is referred a joint resolution described in 
        paragraph (1) has not reported such joint resolution (or an 
        identical joint resolution) at the end of 20 calendar days 
        after the submission date, such committee may be discharged 
        from further consideration of such joint resolution upon a 
        petition supported in writing by 30 Senators, and such joint 
        resolution shall be placed on the calendar.
            (5) Senate consideration of resolution.--
                    (A) Motions.--In the Senate, when the committee to 
                which a joint resolution is referred has reported, or 
                when a committee is discharged (under paragraph (4)) 
                from further consideration of a joint resolution 
                described in paragraph (1), it is at any time 
                thereafter in order (even though a previous motion to 
                the same effect has been disagreed to) for a motion to 
                proceed to the consideration of the joint resolution, 
                and all points of order against the joint resolution 
                (and against consideration of the joint resolution) are 
                waived. The motion is not subject to amendment, or to a 
                motion to postpone, or to a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of other business. A motion to reconsider 
                the vote by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed 
                to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of the joint resolution is agreed to, the 
                joint resolution shall remain the unfinished business 
                of the Senate until disposed of.
                    (B) Debate.--In the Senate, debate on the joint 
                resolution, and on all debatable motions and appeals in 
                connection therewith, shall be limited to not more than 
                10 hours, which shall be divided equally between those 
                favoring and those opposing the joint resolution. A 
                motion further to limit debate is in order and not 
                debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or 
                a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution 
                is not in order.
                    (C) Vote on passage.--In the Senate, immediately 
                following the conclusion of the debate on a joint 
                resolution described in paragraph (1), and a single 
                quorum call at the conclusion of the debate if 
                requested in accordance with the rules of the Senate, 
                the vote on final passage of the joint resolution shall 
                occur.
                    (D) Appeals of decisions of the chair.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate to the procedure 
                relating to a joint resolution described in paragraph 
                (1) shall be decided without debate.
            (6) Inapplicability of certain provisions.--In the Senate, 
        the procedures specified in paragraph (4) or (5) shall not 
        apply to the consideration of a joint resolution respecting a 
        request--
                    (A) after the expiration of the 60 session days 
                beginning with the applicable submission date; or
                    (B) if the request submitted under subsection (e) 
                was submitted during the period beginning on the date 
                occurring--
                            (i) in the case of the Senate, 60 session 
                        days, or
                            (ii) in the case of the House of 
                        Representatives, 60 legislative days,
                before the date the Congress adjourns a session of 
                Congress through the date on which the same or 
                succeeding Congress first convenes its next session, 
                after the expiration of the 60 session days beginning 
                on the 15th session day after the succeeding session of 
                Congress first convenes.
            (7) Receipt of joint resolution from other house.--If, 
        before the passage by one House of a joint resolution of that 
        House described in paragraph (1), that House receives from the 
        other House a joint resolution described in paragraph (1), then 
        the following procedures shall apply:
                    (A) The joint resolution of the other House shall 
                not be referred to a committee.
                    (B) With respect to a joint resolution described in 
                paragraph (1) of the House receiving the joint 
                resolution--
                            (i) the procedure in that House shall be 
                        the same as if no joint resolution had been 
                        received from the other House; but
                            (ii) the vote on passage shall be on the 
                        joint resolution of the other House.
    (g) Report on Unsecured Weapons in Libya.--Not later than 90 days 
after the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall submit 
a report to Congress examining the extent to which advanced weaponry 
remaining unsecured after the fall of Moammar Qaddafi was used by the 
individuals responsible for the September 11, 2012, attack on the 
United States consulate in Benghazi, Libya.
    (h) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be construed 
as an authorization for the use of military force.

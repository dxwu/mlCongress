SEC. 2. FINDINGS.
    Congress finds the following:
        (1) First Lieutenant Ryan Patrick Jones volunteered to serve 
    the United States in the Army.
        (2) Lieutenant Jones earned his rank, the Army Achievement 
    Medal, the Purple Heart, the Bronze Star, the Iraqi Freedom Medal, 
    the Combat Action Badge, and the War on Terrorism Badge through his 
    dedication to the highest ideals of the United States.
        (3) Lieutenant Jones chose from a young age to generously 
    volunteer his talents to his community, and was recognized with 
    academic, social, and athletic leadership positions throughout his 
    life.
        (4) Lieutenant Jones committed himself to excellence in all 
    aspects of his life, including earning a Bachelor of Science 
    degree, with honors, in civil and environmental engineering.
        (5) While earning his engineering degree at Worcester 
    Polytechnic Institute, Lieutenant Jones was awarded a Reserve 
    Officers' Training Corps scholarship.
        (6) Lieutenant Jones faithfully and expertly led his fellow 
    soldiers as a platoon leader in the Army's First Infantry Division 
    while deployed to Iraq in 2007.
        (7) Lieutenant Jones made the ultimate sacrifice for the United 
    States on May 2, 2007, when he was killed in action by an 
    improvised explosive device set by the enemy.
        (8) Lieutenant Jones' life of service, courage, and honor was 
    made possible by his dedicated parents, Mr. Kevin Jones and Mrs. 
    Elaine Jones, who reside in Westminster, Massachusetts.
        (9) Mr. and Mrs. Jones organized the shipment of supplies to 
    soldiers serving alongside their son, thereby supporting the morale 
    of the members of the Armed Forces.
        (10) Before entering combat, Lieutenant Jones made arrangements 
    to ensure that his life insurance policy proceeds would become a

    Jones fulfilled.
        (11) Lieutenant Jones is remembered by his family, his friends, 
    and the people of the United States as a role model for his fellow

    commemorated by organizations ranging from the Commonwealth of 
    Massachusetts to the Boston Celtics.

    Section 251 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control 
Act of 1985 is amended to read as follows:

``SEC. 251. ENFORCING DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.

    ``(a) Enforcement.--
            ``(1) Sequestration.--Within 15 calendar days after 
        Congress adjourns to end a session there shall be a 
        sequestration to eliminate a budget-year breach, if any.
            ``(2) Eliminating a breach.--Each non-exempt account shall 
        be reduced by a dollar amount calculated by multiplying the 
        enacted level of sequestrable budgetary resources in that 
        account at that time by the uniform percentage necessary to 
        eliminate a breach.
            ``(3) Military personnel.--If the President uses the 
        authority to exempt any personnel account from sequestration 
        under section 255(f), each account within subfunctional 
        category 051 (other than those military personnel accounts for 
        which the authority provided under section 255(f) has been 
        exercised) shall be further reduced by a dollar amount 
        calculated by multiplying the enacted level of non-exempt 
        budgetary resources in that account at that time by the uniform 
        percentage necessary to offset the total dollar amount by which 
        outlays are not reduced in military personnel accounts by 
        reason of the use of such authority.
            ``(4) Part-year appropriations.--If, on the date specified 
        in paragraph (1), there is in effect an Act making or 
        continuing appropriations for part of a fiscal year for any 
        budget account, then the dollar sequestration calculated for 
        that account under paragraphs (2) and (3) shall be subtracted 
        from--
                    ``(A) the annualized amount otherwise available by 
                law in that account under that or a subsequent part-
                year appropriation; and
                    ``(B) when a full-year appropriation for that 
                account is enacted, from the amount otherwise provided 
                by the full-year appropriation.
            ``(5) Look-back.--If, after June 30, an appropriation for 
        the fiscal year in progress is enacted that causes a breach for 
        that year (after taking into account any sequestration of 
        amounts), the discretionary spending limits for the next fiscal 
        year shall be reduced by the amount or amounts of that breach.
            ``(6) Within-session sequestration.--If an appropriation 
        for a fiscal year in progress is enacted (after Congress 
        adjourns to end the session for that budget year and before 
        July 1 of that fiscal year) that causes a breach for that year 
        (after taking into account any prior sequestration of amounts), 
        15 days later there shall be a sequestration to eliminate that 
        breach following the procedures set forth in paragraphs (2) 
        through (4).
            ``(7) Estimates.--
                    ``(A) CBO estimates.--As soon as practicable after 
                Congress completes action on any discretionary 
                appropriation, CBO, after consultation with the 
                Committees on the Budget of the House of 
                Representatives and the Senate, shall provide OMB with 
                an estimate of the amount of discretionary new budget 
                authority for the current year, if any, and the budget 
                year provided by that legislation.
                    ``(B) OMB estimates and explanation of 
                differences.--Not later than 7 calendar days (excluding 
                Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) after the date 
                of enactment of any discretionary appropriation, OMB 
                shall transmit a report to the House of Representatives 
                and to the Senate containing the CBO estimate of that 
                legislation, an OMB estimate of the amount of 
                discretionary new budget authority for the current 
                year, if any, and the budget year provided by that 
                legislation, and an explanation of any difference 
                between the 2 estimates. If during the preparation of 
                the report OMB determines that there is a significant 
                difference between OMB and CBO, OMB shall consult with 
                the Committees on the Budget of the House of 
                Representatives and the Senate regarding that 
                difference and that consultation shall include, to the 
                extent practicable, written communication to those 
                committees that affords such committees the opportunity 
                to comment before the issuance of the report.
                    ``(C) Assumptions and guidelines.--OMB estimates 
                under this paragraph shall be made using current 
                economic and technical assumptions. OMB shall use the 
                OMB estimates transmitted to the Congress under this 
                paragraph. OMB and CBO shall prepare estimates under 
                this paragraph in conformance with scorekeeping 
                guidelines determined after consultation among the 
                House and Senate Committees on the Budget, CBO, and 
                OMB.
                    ``(D) Annual appropriations.--For purposes of this 
                paragraph, amounts provided by annual appropriations 
                shall include any discretionary appropriations for the 
                current year, if any, and the budget year in accounts 
                for which funding is provided in that legislation that 
                result from previously enacted legislation.
    ``(b) Adjustments to Discretionary Spending Limits.--
            ``(1) Concepts and definitions.--When the President submits 
        the budget under section 1105 of title 31, United States Code, 
        OMB shall calculate and the budget shall include adjustments to 
        discretionary spending limits (and those limits as cumulatively 
        adjusted) for the budget year and each outyear to reflect 
        changes in concepts and definitions. Such changes shall equal 
        the baseline levels of new budget authority and outlays using 
        up-to-date concepts and definitions minus those levels using 
        the concepts and definitions in effect before such changes. 
        Such changes may only be made after consultation with the 
        Committees on Appropriations and the Budget of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate and that consultation shall 
        include written communication to such committees that affords 
        such committees the opportunity to comment before official 
        action is taken with respect to such changes.
            ``(2) Sequestration reports.--When OMB submits a 
        sequestration report under section 254(e), (f), or (g) for a 
        fiscal year, OMB shall calculate, and the sequestration report 
        and subsequent budgets submitted by the President under section 
        1105(a) of title 31, United States Code, shall include 
        adjustments to discretionary spending limits (and those limits 
        as adjusted) for the fiscal year and each succeeding year, as 
        follows:
                    ``(A) Emergency appropriations; overseas 
                contingency operations/global war on terrorism.--If, 
                for any fiscal year, appropriations for discretionary 
                accounts are enacted that--
                            ``(i) the President designates as emergency 
                        requirements and that the Congress so 
                        designates in statute on an account by account 
                        basis; or
                            ``(ii) the President designates for 
                        Overseas Contingency Operations/Global War on 
                        Terrorism and that the Congress so designates 
                        in statute on an account by account basis;
                the adjustment shall be the total of such 
                appropriations in discretionary accounts designated as 
                emergency requirements or for Overseas Contingency 
                Operations/Global War on Terrorism, as applicable, and 
                the outlays flowing in all fiscal years from such 
                appropriations.
                    ``(B) Continuing disability reviews and 
                redeterminations.--(i) If a bill or joint resolution 
                making appropriations for a fiscal year is enacted that 
                specifies an amount for continuing disability reviews 
                under titles II and XVI of the Social Security Act and 
                for the cost associated with conducting 
                redeterminations of eligibility under title XVI of the 
                Social Security Act, then the adjustments for that 
                fiscal year shall be the additional new budget

        described in section 201 from the Senate, such joint resolution 
        shall be referred to the Committee on the Judiciary. If the 
        committee fails to report the joint resolution within five 
        legislative days, it shall be in order to move that the House 
        discharge the committee from further consideration of the joint 
        resolution. Such a motion shall not be in order after the House 
        has disposed of a motion to discharge the joint resolution. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
        to its adoption without intervening motion except twenty 
        minutes of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent. If such a motion is adopted, the 
        House shall proceed immediately to consider the joint 
        resolution in accordance with paragraph (3). A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall 
        not be in order.
            (2) Proceeding to consideration.--After the joint 
        resolution has been referred to the appropriate calendar or the 
        committee has been discharged (other than by motion) from its 
        consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to 
        consider the joint resolution in the House. Such a motion shall 
        not be in order after the House has disposed of a motion to 
        proceed with respect to the joint resolution. The previous 
        question shall be considered as ordered on the motion to its 
        adoption without intervening motion. A motion to reconsider the 
        vote by which the motion is disposed of shall not be in order.
            (3) Consideration.--The joint resolution shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the joint 
        resolution and against its consideration are waived. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint 
        resolution to its passage without intervening motion except two 
        hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the proponent 
        and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the joint 
        resolution. A motion to reconsider the vote on passage of the 
        joint resolution shall not be in order.
    (b) Senate Consideration.--(1) If the Senate receives a joint 
resolution described in section 201 from the House of Representatives, 
such joint resolution shall be referred to the appropriate committee of 
the Senate. If such committee has not reported the joint resolution at 
the close of the fifth session day after its receipt by the Senate, 
such committee shall be automatically discharged from further 
consideration of the joint resolution and it shall be placed on the 
calendar.
    (2) Consideration of the joint resolution and on all debatable 
motions and appeals in connection therewith, shall be limited to not 
more than 20 hours, which shall be divided equally between the majority 
and minority leaders or their designees. A motion further to limit 
debate is in order and not debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to 
postpone, or a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution is not in order. 
Any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for not to exceed 1 hour, 
to be divided equally between those favoring and those opposing the 
motion or appeal. All time used for consideration of the joint 
resolution, including time used for quorum calls and voting, shall be 
counted against the total 20 hours of consideration.
    (3) If the Senate has voted to proceed to a joint resolution, the 
vote on passage of the joint resolution shall be taken on or before the 
close of the seventh session day after such joint resolution has been 
reported or discharged or immediately following the conclusion of 
consideration of the joint resolution, and a single quorum call at the 
conclusion of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules of 
the Senate.

                disagreed to) to move to proceed to the consideration 
                of the joint resolution, and all points of order 
                against the joint resolution (and against consideration 
                of the joint resolution) are waived. The motion to 
                proceed is not debatable. The motion is not subject to 
                a motion to postpone. A motion to reconsider the vote 
                by which the motion is agreed to or disagreed to shall 
                not be in order. If a motion to proceed to the 
                consideration of the resolution is agreed to, the joint 
                resolution shall remain the unfinished business until 
                disposed of.

                10 hours, which shall be divided equally between the 
                majority and minority leaders or their designees. A 
                motion further to limit debate is in order and not 
                debatable. An amendment to, or a motion to postpone, or 
                a motion to proceed to the consideration of other 
                business, or a motion to recommit the joint resolution 
                is not in order.
                    ``(C) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to 
                proceed to a joint resolution, the vote on passage of 
                the joint resolution shall occur immediately following 
                the conclusion of consideration of the joint 
                resolution, and a single quorum call at the conclusion 
                of the debate if requested in accordance with the rules 
                of the Senate.
                    ``(D) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals 
                from the decisions of the Chair relating to the 
                application of the rules of the Senate, as the case may 
                be, to the procedure relating to a joint resolution 
                shall be decided without debate.
    ``(e) Amendment Not in Order.--A joint resolution of disapproval 
considered pursuant to this section shall not be subject to amendment 
in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
    ``(f) Coordination With Action by Other House.--
            ``(1) In general.--If, before passing the joint resolution, 
        one House receives from the other a joint resolution--
                    ``(A) the joint resolution of the other House shall 
                not be referred to a committee; and
                    ``(B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be 
                the same as if no joint resolution had been received

SEC. 402. EXPEDITED CONSIDERATION OF JOINT COMMITTEE RECOMMENDATIONS.

    (a) Introduction.--If approved by the majority required by section 
401(b)(3)(B)(ii), the proposed legislative language submitted pursuant 
to section 401(b)(3)(B)(iv) shall be introduced in the Senate (by 
request) on the next day on which the Senate is in session by the 
majority leader of the Senate or by a Member of the Senate designated 
by the majority leader of the Senate and shall be introduced in the 
House of Representatives (by request) on the next legislative day by 
the majority leader of the House or by a Member of the House designated 
by the majority leader of the House.
    (b) Consideration in the House of Representatives.--
            (1) Referral and reporting.--Any committee of the House of 
        Representatives to which the joint committee bill is referred 
        shall report it to the House without amendment not later than 
        December 9, 2011. If a committee fails to report the joint 
        committee bill within that period, it shall be in order to move 
        that the House discharge the committee from further 
        consideration of the bill. Such a motion shall not be in order 
        after the last committee authorized to consider the bill 
        reports it to the House or after the House has disposed of a 
        motion to discharge the bill. The previous question shall be 
        considered as ordered on the motion to its adoption without 
        intervening motion except 20 minutes of debate equally divided 
        and controlled by the proponent and an opponent. If such a 
        motion is adopted, the House shall proceed immediately to 
        consider the joint committee bill in accordance with paragraphs 
        (2) and (3). A motion to reconsider the vote by which the 
        motion is disposed of shall not be in order.
            (2) Proceeding to consideration.--After the last committee 
        authorized to consider a joint committee bill reports it to the 
        House or has been discharged (other than by motion) from its 
        consideration, it shall be in order to move to proceed to 
        consider the joint committee bill in the House. Such a motion 
        shall not be in order after the House has disposed of a motion 
        to proceed with respect to the joint committee bill. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the motion 
        to its adoption without intervening motion. A motion to 
        reconsider the vote by which the motion is disposed of shall 
        not be in order.
            (3) Consideration.--The joint committee bill shall be 
        considered as read. All points of order against the joint 
        committee bill and against its consideration are waived. The 
        previous question shall be considered as ordered on the joint 
        committee bill to its passage without intervening motion except 
        2 hours of debate equally divided and controlled by the 
        proponent and an opponent and one motion to limit debate on the 
        joint committee bill. A motion to reconsider the vote on 
        passage of the joint committee bill shall not be in order.
            (4) Vote on passage.--The vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill shall occur not later than December 23, 2011.
    (c) Expedited Procedure in the Senate.--
            (1) Committee consideration.--A joint committee bill 
        introduced in the Senate under subsection (a) shall be jointly 
        referred to the committee or committees of jurisdiction, which 
        committees shall report the bill without any revision and with 
        a favorable recommendation, an unfavorable recommendation, or 
        without recommendation, not later than December 9, 2011. If any 
        committee fails to report the bill within that period, that 
        committee shall be automatically discharged from consideration 
        of the bill, and the bill shall be placed on the appropriate 
        calendar.
            (2) Motion to proceed.--Notwithstanding Rule XXII of the 
        Standing Rules of the Senate, it is in order, not later than 2 
        days of session after the date on which a joint committee bill 
        is reported or discharged from all committees to which it was 
        referred, for the majority leader of the Senate or the majority 
        leader's designee to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint committee bill. It shall also be in order for any 
        Member of the Senate to move to proceed to the consideration of 
        the joint committee bill at any time after the conclusion of 
        such 2-day period. A motion to proceed is in order even though 
        a previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to. All 
        points of order against the motion to proceed to the joint 
        committee bill are waived. The motion to proceed is not 
        debatable. The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone. A 
        motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion is agreed to 
        or disagreed to shall not be in order. If a motion to proceed 
        to the consideration of the joint committee bill is agreed to, 
        the joint committee bill shall remain the unfinished business 
        until disposed of.
            (3) Consideration.--All points of order against the joint 
        committee bill and against consideration of the joint committee 
        bill are waived. Consideration of the joint committee bill and 
        of all debatable motions and appeals in connection therewith 
        shall not exceed a total of 30 hours which shall be divided 
        equally between the Majority and Minority Leaders or their 
        designees. A motion further to limit debate on the joint 
        committee bill is in order, shall require an affirmative vote 
        of three-fifths of the Members duly chosen and sworn, and is 
        not debatable. Any debatable motion or appeal is debatable for 
        not to exceed 1 hour, to be divided equally between those 
        favoring and those opposing the motion or appeal. All time used 
        for consideration of the joint committee bill, including time 
        used for quorum calls and voting, shall be counted against the 
        total 30 hours of consideration.
            (4) No amendments.--An amendment to the joint committee 
        bill, or a motion to postpone, or a motion to proceed to the 
        consideration of other business, or a motion to recommit the 
        joint committee bill, is not in order.
            (5) Vote on passage.--If the Senate has voted to proceed to 
        the joint committee bill, the vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill shall occur immediately following the conclusion 
        of the debate on a joint committee bill, and a single quorum 
        call at the conclusion of the debate if requested. The vote on 
        passage of the joint committee bill shall occur not later than 
        December 23, 2011.
            (6) Rulings of the chair on procedure.--Appeals from the 
        decisions of the Chair relating to the application of the rules 
        of the Senate, as the case may be, to the procedure relating to 
        a joint committee bill shall be decided without debate.
    (d) Amendment.--The joint committee bill shall not be subject to 
amendment in either the House of Representatives or the Senate.
    (e) Consideration by the Other House.--
            (1) In general.--If, before passing the joint committee 
        bill, one House receives from the other a joint committee 
        bill--
                    (A) the joint committee bill of the other House 
                shall not be referred to a committee; and
                    (B) the procedure in the receiving House shall be 
                the same as if no joint committee bill had been 
                received from the other House until the vote on 
                passage, when the joint committee bill received from 
                the other House shall supplant the joint committee bill 
                of the receiving House.
            (2) Revenue measure.--This subsection shall not apply to 
        the House of Representatives if the joint committee bill 
        received from the Senate is a revenue measure.
    (f) Rules to Coordinate Action With Other House.--
            (1) Treatment of joint committee bill of other house.--If 
        the Senate fails to introduce or consider a joint committee 
        bill under this section, the joint committee bill of the House 
        shall be entitled to expedited floor procedures under this 
        section.
            (2) Treatment of companion measures in the senate.--If 
        following passage of the joint committee bill in the Senate, 
        the Senate then receives the joint committee bill from the 
        House of Representatives, the House-passed joint committee bill 
        shall not be debatable. The vote on passage of the joint 
        committee bill in the Senate shall be considered to be the vote 
        on passage of the joint committee bill received from the House 
        of Representatives.
            (3) Vetoes.--If the President vetoes the joint committee 
        bill, debate on a veto message in the Senate under this section 
        shall be 1 hour equally divided between the majority and 
        minority leaders or their designees.
    (g) Loss of Privilege.--The provisions of this section shall cease 
to apply to the joint committee bill if--
            (1) the joint committee fails to vote on the report or 
        proposed legislative language required under section 
        201(b)(3)(B)(i) by November 23, 2011; or
            (2) the joint committee bill does not pass both Houses by 
        December 23, 2011.

SEC. 403. FUNDING.

    Funding for the joint committee shall be derived in equal portions 
from--
            (1) the applicable accounts of the House of 
        Representatives; and
            (2) the contingent fund of the Senate from the 
        appropriations account ``Miscellaneous Items'', subject to 
        Senate rules and regulations.

SEC. 404. RULEMAKING.

    The provisions of this title are enacted by Congress--
            (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of 
        Representatives and the Senate, respectively, and as such they 
        shall be considered as part of the rules of each House, 
        respectively, or of that House to which they specifically 
        apply, and such rules shall supersede other rules only to the 
        extent that they are inconsistent therewith; and
            (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of 
        either House to change such rules (so far as relating to such 
        House) at any time, in the same manner, and to the same extent 
        as in the case of any other rule of such House.

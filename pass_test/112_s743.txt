        agreement described under paragraph (1) that does not contain 
        the statement required under paragraph (1) may not be

        agreement is inconsistent with that statement.
            (B) Nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement in effect 
        before the effective date.--With respect to a nondisclosure 
        policy, form, or agreement that was in effect before the 
        effective date of this Act, but that does not contain the 
        statement required under paragraph (1) for implementation or 
        enforcement--
                (i) it shall not be a prohibited personnel practice to 
            enforce that policy, form, or agreement with regard to a

            of the statement; and
                (ii) it shall not be a prohibited personnel practice to 
            enforce that policy, form, or agreement after the effective

form, or agreement shall, at a minimum, require that the person will 
not disclose any classified information received in the course of such 
activity unless specifically authorized to do so by the United States 
Government. Such nondisclosure policy, form, or agreement shall also 
make it clear that such forms do not bar disclosures to Congress or to 
an authorized official of an executive agency or the Department of 
Justice that are essential to reporting a substantial violation of law, 
consistent with the protection of sources and methods.

  To direct the Secretary of the Interior to allow for prepayment of 
  repayment contracts between the United States and the Uintah Water 
                         Conservancy District.

    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the 
United States of America in Congress assembled,

SECTION 1. PREPAYMENT OF CERTAIN REPAYMENT CONTRACTS BETWEEN THE UNITED 
              STATES AND THE UINTAH WATER CONSERVANCY DISTRICT.

    The Secretary of the Interior shall allow for prepayment of the 
repayment contract no. 6-05-01-00143 between the United States and the 
Uintah Water Conservancy District dated June 3, 1976, and supplemented 
and amended on November 1, 1985, and on December 30, 1992, providing 
for repayment of municipal and industrial water delivery facilities for 
which repayment is provided pursuant to such contract, under terms and 
conditions similar to those used in implementing section 210 of the 
Central Utah Project Completion Act (Public Law 102-575), as amended. 
The prepayment--
            (1) shall result in the United States recovering the net 
        present value of all repayment streams that would have been 
        payable to the United States if this Act was not in effect;
            (2) may be provided in several installments to reflect 
        substantial completion of the delivery facilities being 
        prepaid, and any increase in the repayment obligation resulting 
        from delivery of water in addition to the water being delivered 
        under this contract as of the date of enactment of this Act;
            (3) shall be adjusted to conform to a final cost allocation 
        including costs incurred by the Bureau of Reclamation, but 
        unallocated as of the date of the enactment of this Act that 
        are allocable to the water delivered under this contract;
            (4) may not be adjusted on the basis of the type of 
        prepayment financing used by the District; and
            (5) shall be made such that total repayment is made not 
        later than September 30, 2022.

            Passed the Senate November 2, 2011.

            Attest:

                                                             Secretary.

                               RESOLUTION


 
 Honoring the victims and heroes of the shooting on January 8, 2011 in 
                            Tucson, Arizona.

Whereas on January 8, 2011, a gunman opened fire at a ``Congress on your 
        Corner'' event hosted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, 
        Arizona, killing 6 and wounding 13 others;
Whereas Christina-Taylor Green, Dorothy Morris, John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, 
        Dorwan Stoddard, and Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman lost their lives in this 
        attack;
Whereas Christina-Taylor Green, the 9-year-old daughter of John and Roxanna 
        Green, was born on September 11, 2001, and was a third grader with an 
        avid interest in government who was recently elected to the student 
        council at Mesa Verde Elementary School;
Whereas Dorothy Morris, who was 76 years old, attended the January 8 event with 
        George, her husband of over 50 years with whom she had 2 daughters, and 
        who was also critically injured as he tried to shield her from the 
        shooting;
Whereas John Roll, a Pennsylvania native who was 63 years old, began his 
        professional career as a bailiff in 1972, was appointed to the Federal 
        bench in 1991, and became chief judge for the District of Arizona in 
        2006, was a devoted husband to his wife Maureen, father to his 3 sons, 
        and grandfather to his 5 grandchildren, and heroically attempted to 
        shield Ron Barber from additional gunfire;
Whereas Phyllis Schneck, a proud mother of 3, grandmother of 7, and great-
        grandmother from New Jersey, was spending the winter in Arizona, and was 
        a 79-year-old church volunteer and New York Giants fan;
Whereas Dorwan Stoddard, a 76-year-old retired construction worker and volunteer 
        at the Mountain Avenue Church of Christ, is credited with shielding his 
        wife Mavy, a longtime friend whom he married while they were in their 
        60s, who was also injured in the shooting;
Whereas Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman, who was 30 years old and engaged to be 
        married, served as Director of Community Outreach to Representative 
        Gabrielle Giffords, and was a social worker before serving with 
        Representative Giffords;
Whereas Representative Gabrielle Giffords was a target of this attack, and was 
        critically injured;
Whereas 13 others were also wounded in the shooting, including Ron Barber and 
        Pamela Simon, both staffers to Representative Giffords; and
Whereas several individuals, including Patricia Maisch, Army Col. Bill Badger 
        (Retired), who was also wounded in the shooting, Roger Salzgeber, Joseph 
        Zamudio, Daniel Hernandez, Jr., Anna Ballis, and Dr. Steven Rayle helped 
        apprehend the gunman and assist the injured, thereby risking their lives 
        for the safety of others, and should be commended for their bravery: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) condemns in the strongest possible terms the horrific 
        attack which occurred at the ``Congress on your Corner'' event 
        hosted by Representative Gabrielle Giffords in Tucson, Arizona, 
        on January 8, 2011;
            (2) offers its heartfelt condolences to the families, 
        friends, and loved ones of those who were killed in that 
        attack;
            (3) expresses its hope for the rapid and complete recovery 
        of those wounded in the shooting;
            (4) honors the memory of Christina-Taylor Green, Dorothy 
        Morris, John Roll, Phyllis Schneck, Dorwan Stoddard, and 
        Gabriel Matthew Zimmerman;
            (5) applauds the bravery and quick thinking exhibited by 
        those individuals who prevented the gunman from potentially 
        taking more lives and helped to save those who had been 
        wounded;
            (6) recognizes the service of the first responders who 
        raced to the scene and the health care professionals who tended 
        to the victims once they reached the hospital, whose service 
        and skill saved lives;
            (7) reaffirms the bedrock principle of American democracy 
        and representative government, which is memorialized in the 
        First Amendment of the Constitution and which Representative 
        Gabrielle Giffords herself read in the Hall of the House of 
        Representatives on January 6, 2011, of ``the right of the 
        people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government 
        for a redress of grievances'';
            (8) stands firm in its belief in a democracy in which all 
        can participate and in which intimidation and threats of 
        violence cannot silence the voices of any American;
            (9) honors the service and leadership of Representative 
        Gabrielle Giffords, a distinguished member of the House of 
        Representatives, as she courageously fights to recover; and
            (10) when adjourning today, shall do so out of respect to 
        the victims of this attack.
                                 <all>

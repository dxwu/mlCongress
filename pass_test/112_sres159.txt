                               RESOLUTION


 
  Honoring the members of the military and intelligence community who 
  carried out the mission that killed Osama bin Laden, and for other 
                               purposes.

Whereas, on May 1, 2011, United States personnel killed terrorist leader Osama 
        bin Laden during the course of a targeted strike against his secret 
        compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan;
Whereas Osama bin Laden was the leader of the al Qaeda terrorist organization, 
        the most significant terrorism threat to the United States and the 
        international community;
Whereas Osama bin Laden was the architect of terrorist attacks which killed 
        nearly 3,000 civilians on September 11, 2001, the most deadly terrorist 
        attack against our Nation, in which al Qaeda terrorists hijacked four 
        airplanes and crashed them into the World Trade Center in New York City, 
        the Pentagon in Washington, D.C., and, due to heroic efforts by civilian 
        passengers to disrupt the terrorists, near Shanksville, Pennsylvania;
Whereas Osama bin Laden planned or supported numerous other deadly terrorist 
        attacks against the United States and its allies, including the 1998 
        bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania and the 2000 
        attack on the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen, and against innocent civilians in 
        countries around the world, including the 2004 attack on commuter trains 
        in Madrid, Spain and the 2005 bombings of the mass transit system in 
        London, England;
Whereas, following the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, the United States, 
        under President George W. Bush, led an international coalition into 
        Afghanistan to dismantle al Qaeda, deny them a safe haven in Afghanistan 
        and ungoverned areas along the Pakistani border, and bring Osama bin 
        Laden to justice;
Whereas President Barack Obama in 2009 committed additional forces and resources 
        to efforts in Afghanistan and Pakistan as ``the central front in our 
        enduring struggle against terrorism and extremism'';
Whereas the valiant members of the United States Armed Forces have courageously 
        and vigorously pursued al Qaeda and its affiliates in Afghanistan and 
        around the world;
Whereas the anonymous, unsung heroes of the intelligence community have pursued 
        al Qaeda and affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, and around the world 
        with tremendous dedication, sacrifice, and professionalism;
Whereas the close collaboration between the Armed Forces and the intelligence 
        community prompted the Director of National Intelligence, General James 
        Clapper, to state, ``Never have I seen a more remarkable example of 
        focused integration, seamless collaboration, and sheer professional 
        magnificence as was demonstrated by the Intelligence Community in the 
        ultimate demise of Osama bin Laden.'';
Whereas, while the death of Osama bin Laden represents a significant blow to the 
        al Qaeda organization and its affiliates and to terrorist organizations 
        around the world, terrorism remains a critical threat to United States 
        national security; and
Whereas President Obama said, ``For over two decades, bin Laden has been al 
        Qaeda's leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our 
        country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the 
        most significant achievement to date in our Nation's effort to defeat al 
        Qaeda.'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) declares that the death of Osama bin Laden represents a 
        measure of justice and relief for the families and friends of 
        the nearly 3,000 men and women who lost their lives on 
        September 11, 2001, the men and women in the United States and 
        around the world who have been killed by other al Qaeda-
        sponsored attacks, the men and women of the United States Armed 
        Forces and the intelligence community who have sacrificed their 
        lives pursuing Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda;
            (2) commends the men and women of the United States Armed 
        Forces and the United States intelligence community for the 
        tremendous commitment, perseverance, professionalism, and 
        sacrifice they displayed in bringing Osama bin Laden to 
        justice;
            (3) commends the men and women of the United States Armed 
        Forces and the United States intelligence community for 
        committing themselves to defeating, disrupting, and dismantling 
        al Qaeda;
            (4) commends the President for ordering the successful 
        operations to locate and eliminate Osama bin Laden; and
            (5) reaffirms its commitment to disrupting, dismantling, 
        and defeating al Qaeda and affiliated organizations around the 
        world that threaten United States national security, 
        eliminating a safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan and 
        Pakistan, and bringing terrorists to justice.

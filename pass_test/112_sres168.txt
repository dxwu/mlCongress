                               RESOLUTION


 
 Commemorating and acknowledging the dedication and sacrifice made by 
 the Federal, State, and local law enforcement officers who have been 
                 killed or injured in the line of duty.

Whereas the well-being of all citizens of the United States is preserved and 
        enhanced as a direct result of the vigilance and dedication of law 
        enforcement personnel;
Whereas more than 900,000 men and women, at great risk to their personal safety, 
        presently serve their fellow citizens as guardians of the peace;
Whereas peace officers are on the front lines in protecting the schools and 
        schoolchildren of the United States;
Whereas in 2010, 158 peace officers across the United States were killed in the 
        line of duty;
Whereas Congress should strongly support initiatives to reduce violent crime and 
        to increase the factors that contribute to the safety of law enforcement 
        officers;
Whereas there are recorded 18,983 Federal, State, and local law enforcement 
        officers who lost their lives in the line of duty while protecting their 
        fellow citizens, and whose names are engraved upon the National Law 
        Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, District of Columbia;
Whereas in 1962, President John F. Kennedy designated May 15 as National Peace 
        Officers Memorial Day; and\\
Whereas on May 15, 2011, more than 20,000 peace officers are expected to gather 
        in Washington, District of Columbia, to join with the families of their 
        recently fallen comrades to honor those comrades and all others who went 
        before them: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) commemorates and acknowledges the dedication and 
        sacrifices made by the Federal, State, and local law 
        enforcement officers who have been killed or injured in the 
        line of duty;
            (2) recognizes May 15, 2011, as ``National Peace Officers 
        Memorial Day''; and
            (3) calls on the people of the United States to observe 
        that day with appropriate ceremony, solemnity, appreciation, 
        and respect.
                                 <all>

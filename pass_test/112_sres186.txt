    Honoring the 100th anniversary of the United States Army Field 
                Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.

Whereas May 19, 2011, has been set aside as Field Artillery Day at Fort Sill, 
        Oklahoma, the Home of the Field Artillery, to commemorate the 100th 
        anniversary of the School of Fire for the Field Artillery;
Whereas the School of Fire for the Field Artillery at Fort Sill was established 
        on June 5, 1911, under the command of Captain Dan T. Moore, its first 
        commandant;
Whereas the first class of 14 captains and 22 non-commissioned officers arrived 
        on September 15, 1911, and the school continues to operate today as the 
        world renowned United States Army Field Artillery School;
Whereas thousands of soldiers, Marines, and allied foreign military students 
        have been trained for service in the Field Artillery at the United 
        States Army Field Artillery School;
Whereas the Field Artillery lives up to its nickname, ``The King of Battle'', by 
        continuing to be the most responsive all-weather fire support available 
        to ground forces engaged in combat;
Whereas the modern Field Artillery branch employs, and the United States Army 
        Field Artillery School trains troops on, a variety of powerful weapons, 
        from the 105 millimeter M-199 howitzer, the 155 millimeter M-777 
        lightweight howitzer, and the 155 millimeter Paladin self-propelled 
        howitzer to the Multiple Launch Rocket System;
Whereas the United States Army Field Artillery School has trained Field 
        Artillery officers and non-commissioned officers to be the Army's 
        experts on the employment of lethal and non-lethal effects that have 
        contributed to our Nation's successes in Iraq and Afghanistan;
Whereas Field Artillery officers stand among our Nation's most revered civilian 
        and military leaders, including founding fathers and Revolutionary War 
        officers Alexander Hamilton and Henry Knox; Major General William J. 
        Snow, the first Chief of the Field Artillery; Captain Harry S. Truman of 
        the Missouri National Guard; Generals Jack Vessey, John Shalikashvili, 
        and Maxwell Taylor, Chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Generals 
        William Westmoreland, Carl Vuono, and Dennis Reimer, Chiefs of Staff of 
        the Army; General Tommy Franks, U.S. Central Command Commander who led 
        coalition forces during Operation Iraqi Freedom; and General Raymond 
        Odierno, U.S. Joint Forces Command Commander, who led Multi-National 
        Forces-Iraq;
Whereas Field Artillerymen have fought with courage, strength, and fidelity in 
        every United States conflict, and have been awarded more than 90 Medals 
        of Honor, including, most recently, a Medal of Honor awarded 
        posthumously to Sergeant First Class Jared Monti, a forward observer in 
        Afghanistan who demonstrated conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity as he 
        called in artillery fire to save his outnumbered patrol and was mortally 
        wounded as he attempted to save a fellow soldier; and
Whereas the people of the United States take great pride in the history of Fort 
        Sill, the United States Army Field Artillery School, and the continuing 
        critical role that the Field Artillery plays in the defense of the 
        United States: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) honors the 100th anniversary of the United States Army 
        Field Artillery School at Fort Sill, Oklahoma; and
            (2) honors the long line of men and women of the Army Field 
        Artillery who have served and continue to serve in the 
        protection of the national security of the United States.
                                 <all>

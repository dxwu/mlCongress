                               RESOLUTION


 
  Designating the month of October 2011 as ``National Medicine Abuse 
                           Awareness Month''.

Whereas over-the-counter and prescription medicines approved by the Food and 
        Drug Administration have been determined to be safe and effective when 
        used properly;
Whereas the abuse of such medicines can be extremely dangerous and produce 
        serious side effects;
Whereas according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services 
        Administration's 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, the 
        nonmedical use of prescription drugs has risen, with 2.5 percent of the 
        population engaging in nonmedical use of prescription drugs in 2008 and 
        2.8 percent of the population engaging in such use in 2009;
Whereas the 2010 National Survey on Drug Use and Health illustrates that the 
        abuse of prescription medications such as pain relievers, tranquilizers, 
        stimulants, and sedatives is second only to marijuana, the most commonly 
        abused illegal drug in the United States;
Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey, funded by the National Institutes 
        of Health, indicates that approximately 5 percent of teenagers in the 
        United States report having abused an over-the-counter cough medicine to 
        get high, and prescription and over-the-counter drugs account for 8 of 
        the 14 most frequently abused drugs by students in grade 12;
Whereas the 2010 Monitoring the Future survey also indicates that the 
        intentional abuse of cough medicine among students in grades 8, 10, and 
        12 is at 3.2 percent, 5.1 percent, and 6.6 percent, respectively;
Whereas according to research from The Partnership at DrugFree.org, more than 
        one-third of teenagers mistakenly believe that taking prescription 
        drugs, even if not prescribed by a doctor, is much safer than using 
        street drugs;
Whereas the lack of understanding by teenagers and parents of the potential harm 
        of such powerful medicines makes it more critical than ever to raise 
        public awareness about the dangers of the abuse of such drugs;
Whereas when prescription drugs are abused, such drugs are most often obtained 
        through friends and relatives;
Whereas parents should be aware that the Internet gives teenagers access to 
        websites that promote the abuse of medicines;
Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month'' promotes 
        the message that over-the-counter and prescription medicines should be 
        taken only as labeled or prescribed, and such medicines can have serious 
        or life-threatening consequences when used to get high or in large 
        doses;
Whereas the designation of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month'' will 
        encourage parents to educate themselves about the problem of abuse of 
        over-the-counter and prescription medicines, and talk to their teens 
        about all types of substance abuse;
Whereas observance of ``National Medicine Abuse Awareness Month'' should be 
        encouraged at the national, State, and local levels to increase 
        awareness of the abuse of medicines;
Whereas educational tools, training programs, and strategies have been developed 
        by the national organization that represents 5,000 anti-drug coalitions 
        nationwide and the association representing makers of over-the-counter 
        medicines, in order to help local coalitions demonstrate the best ways 
        to engage and educate parents and grandparents, teachers, law 
        enforcement officials, doctors, other healthcare professionals, and 
        retailers about the potential harms of cough medicine abuse;
Whereas a partnership of nonprofit associations specializing in raising media 
        awareness about substance abuse and organizations that represent the 
        leading makers of over-the-counter drugs have developed a nationwide 
        prevention campaign that utilizes research-based educational 
        advertisements, public relations and news media, and the Internet to 
        inform parents about the negative teen behavior of intentional abuse of 
        medicines, in order to empower parents to effectively communicate with 
        their children about this dangerous trend and to take necessary steps to 
        safeguard prescription and over-the-counter medicines in their homes; 
        and
Whereas educating the public on the dangers of medicine abuse and promoting 
        prevention of medicine abuse are critical components of what must be a 
        multi-pronged effort to curb prescription and over-the-counter medicine 
        abuse: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates the month of October 2011 as ``National 
        Medicine Abuse Awareness Month''; and
            (2) urges communities to carry out appropriate programs and 
        activities to educate parents and youth about the potential 
        dangers associated with medicine abuse.

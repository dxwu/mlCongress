                               RESOLUTION


 
Raising awareness and encouraging prevention of stalking by designating 
         January 2011 as ``National Stalking Awareness Month''.

Whereas in a 1-year period, an estimated 3,400,000 people in the United States 
        reported being stalked, and 75 percent of victims report that they were 
        stalked by someone they know;
Whereas 81 percent of women who are stalked by an intimate partner are also 
        physically assaulted by that partner, and 76 percent of women who are 
        killed by an intimate partner were also stalked by that intimate 
        partner;
Whereas 11 percent of victims reported having been stalked for more than 5 
        years, and 23 percent of victims reported having been stalked almost 
        every day;
Whereas 1 in 4 victims reported that they were aware of email, instant 
        messaging, blogs or bulletin boards, internet sites, or chat rooms being 
        used against them by their stalkers, and 1 in 13 victims reported that 
        stalkers had used electronic devices to monitor them;
Whereas stalking victims are forced to take drastic measures to protect 
        themselves, including changing identity, relocating, changing jobs, and 
        obtaining protection orders;
Whereas 1 in 7 victims has relocated in an effort to escape a stalker;
Whereas approximately 130,000 victims reported having been fired or asked to 
        leave a job because of stalking, and about 1 in 8 employed victims 
        missed work because they feared for their safety or were taking steps to 
        protect themselves, such as seeking a restraining order;
Whereas less than half of victims report stalking to police, and only 7 percent 
        of victims contacted a victim service provider, shelter, or hotline;
Whereas stalking is a crime under Federal law and under the laws of all 50 
        States, the District of Columbia, and the territories of the United 
        States;
Whereas stalking affects victims of every race, age, culture, gender, sexual 
        orientation, physical and mental ability, and economic status;
Whereas national organizations, local victim service organizations, prosecutors' 
        offices, and police departments stand ready to assist stalking victims 
        and are working diligently to develop effective and innovative responses 
        to stalking;
Whereas there is a need to improve the criminal justice system's response to 
        stalking through more aggressive investigation and prosecution;
Whereas there is a need for increased availability of victim services across the 
        country, and such services must include programs tailored to meet the 
        needs of stalking victims; and
Whereas the Senate finds that ``National Stalking Awareness Month'' provides an 
        opportunity to educate the people of the United States about stalking: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates January 2011 as ``National Stalking 
        Awareness Month'';
            (2) applauds the efforts of the many stalking victim 
        service providers, police, prosecutors, national and community 
        organizations, and private sector supporters for their efforts 
        in promoting awareness about stalking;
            (3) encourages policymakers, criminal justice officials, 
        victim service and human service agencies, college campuses and 
        universities, nonprofit organizations, and others to increase 
        awareness of stalking and the availability of services for 
        stalking victims; and
            (4) urges national and community organizations, businesses 
        in the private sector, and the media to promote awareness of 
        the crime of stalking through ``National Stalking Awareness 
        Month''.

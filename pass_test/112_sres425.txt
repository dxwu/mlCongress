                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating April 23, 2012, as ``National Adopt a Library Day''.

Whereas libraries are an essential part of the communities and the national 
        system of education in the United States;
Whereas the people of the United States benefit significantly from libraries 
        that serve as an open place for people of all ages and backgrounds to 
        use books and other resources that offer pathways to learning, self-
        discovery, and the pursuit of knowledge;
Whereas libraries in the United States depend on the generous donations and 
        support of individuals and groups to ensure that people who are unable 
        to purchase books still have access to a wide variety of resources;
Whereas certain nonprofit organizations facilitate the donation of books to 
        schools and libraries across the United States to extend the joy of 
        reading to millions of people of the United States and to prevent used 
        books from being thrown away;
Whereas libraries in the United States have provided valuable resources to 
        individuals who are affected by the economic crisis by encouraging 
        continued education and job training;
Whereas libraries are increasingly being used as a resource for those seeking 
        the tools and information to enter or reenter the workforce; and
Whereas several States that recognize the importance of libraries and reading 
        have adopted resolutions commemorating April 23 as ``Adopt a Library 
        Day'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates April 23, 2012, as ``National Adopt a 
        Library Day'';
            (2) honors the organizations that facilitate donations to 
        schools and libraries;
            (3) urges all people of the United States who own unused 
        books to donate the books to local libraries;
            (4) strongly supports children and families who take 
        advantage of the resources provided by schools and libraries; 
        and
            (5) encourages the people of the United States to observe 
        ``National Adopt A Library Day'' with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities.
                                 <all>

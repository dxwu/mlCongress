                   IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES

                           September 12, 2012

    Mr. Kohl (for himself, Ms. Mikulski, Ms. Collins, Mr. Enzi, Mr.

                               RESOLUTION


 
    Designating September 22, 2012, as ``National Falls Prevention 
  Awareness Day'' to raise awareness and encourage the prevention of 
                       falls among older adults.

Whereas older adults, 65 years of age and older, are the fastest-growing segment 
        of the population in the United States, and the number of older adults 
        in the United States will increase from 35,000,000 in 2000 to 72,100,000 
        in 2030;
Whereas 1 out of 3 older adults in the United States falls each year;
Whereas falls are the leading cause of injury, death, and hospital admissions 
        for traumatic injuries among older adults;
Whereas, in 2010, approximately 2,300,000 older adults were treated in hospital 
        emergency departments for fall-related injuries, and more than 650,000 
        were subsequently hospitalized;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2008, 
        more than 20,000 older adults died from injuries related to 
        unintentional falls;
Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the total 
        cost of fall-related injuries for older adults is $80,900,000,000, 
        including more than $28,300,000,000 in direct medical costs;
Whereas the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that if the rate 
        of increase in falls is not slowed, the annual cost under the Medicare 
        program will reach $59,600,000,000 by 2020; and
Whereas evidence-based programs show promise in reducing falls and facilitating 
        cost-effective interventions, such as comprehensive clinical 
        assessments, exercise programs to improve balance and health, management 
        of medications, correction of vision, and reduction of home hazards: 
        Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) designates September 22, 2012, as ``National Falls 
        Prevention Awareness Day'';
            (2) commends the Falls Free Coalition and the falls 
        prevention coalitions in 43 States and the District of Columbia 
        for their efforts to work together to increase education and 
        awareness about the prevention of falls among older adults;
            (3) encourages businesses, individuals, Federal, State, and 
        local governments, the public health community, and health care 
        providers to work together to promote the awareness of falls in 
        an effort to reduce the incidence of falls among older adults 
        in the United States;
            (4) urges the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to 
        continue developing and evaluating strategies to prevent falls 
        among older adults that will translate into effective fall 
        prevention interventions, including community-based programs;
            (5) encourages State health departments, which provide 
        significant leadership in reducing injuries and injury-related 
        health care costs by collaborating with colleagues and a 
        variety of organizations and individuals, to reduce falls among 
        older adults; and
            (6) recognizes proven, cost-effective falls prevention 
        programs and policies and encourages experts in the field to 
        share their best practices so that their success can be 
        replicated by others.

  Recognizing the Defense Intelligence Agency on its 50th Anniversary.

Whereas, the Defense Intelligence Agency was created in 1961 as the United 
        States lead military intelligence organization, approved by Secretary of 
        Defense Robert McNamara on July 5, 1961, and activated on October 1, 
        1961;
Whereas, with military and civilian employees worldwide, the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency produces military intelligence to warfighters and 
        policymakers in the Department of Defense and the intelligence 
        community, to support United States military planning, operations, and 
        weapon systems acquisition;
Whereas the Defense Intelligence Agency possesses a diverse and expeditionary 
        workforce that conducts all-source analysis, intelligence collection, 
        and information technology infrastructure support around the world;
Whereas the Defense Intelligence Agency plays a critical role within the 
        Department of Defense, the combatant commands, the intelligence 
        community, and the Defense Intelligence Enterprise through the Defense 
        Attache System, Defense Counterintelligence and HUMINT Center, National 
        Defense Intelligence College, National Media Exploitation Center, and 
        National Center for Credibility Assessment;
Whereas the Defense Intelligence Agency leads the defense all-source analytic 
        community including the Directorate for Analysis and four specialized 
        centers known as the Underground Facility Analysis Center, the National 
        Center for Medical Intelligence, the Joint Intelligence Task Force-
        Combating Terrorism, and the Missile and Space Intelligence Center, as 
        well as synchronizes the analytic efforts of the Army National Ground 
        Intelligence Center, Office of Naval Intelligence, Air Force National 
        Air and Space Intelligence Center, Marine Corps Intelligence Activity, 
        and ten United States combatant command intelligence centers;
Whereas the Defense Intelligence Agency has throughout its history provided 
        intelligence support to United States policy makers and military 
        commanders in both war and peacetime during significant national 
        security events including the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Vietnam 
        conflict, the Cold War and its aftermath, operations against state-
        sponsored terrorist organizations, Operation Desert Storm, and in 
        support of United States military and coalition operations in Somalia, 
        the former Yugoslavia, and Haiti;
Whereas, since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the men and women of 
        the Defense Intelligence Agency have worked diligently to deter, detect, 
        and prevent acts of terror by providing intelligence support to United 
        States and coalition forces in support of the Global War on Terror, 
        Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan, and Operation Iraqi Freedom; 
        and
Whereas the Defense Intelligence Agency and subordinate organizations within the 
        Agency have been awarded seven Joint Meritorious Unit Awards reflecting 
        the distinctive accomplishments of the personnel assigned to the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) congratulates the men and women of the Defense 
        Intelligence Agency on the occasion of the Agency's 50th 
        Anniversary;
            (2) honors the heroic sacrifice of the employees of the 
        Defense Intelligence Agency who have given their lives, or have 
        been wounded or injured, in the service of the United States 
        during the past 50 years; and
            (3) expresses gratitude to all the men and women of the 
        Defense Intelligence Agency for their past and continued 
        efforts to provide timely and accurate intelligence support to 
        deliver overwhelming advantage to our warfighters, defense 
        planners, and defense and national security policymakers in the 
        defense and security of the United States.
                                 <all>

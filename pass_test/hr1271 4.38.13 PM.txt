SEC. 5. SENSE OF CONGRESS ON THE YEAR 2000 PROBLEM.

    With the year 2000 fast approaching, it is the sense of Congress 
that the Federal Aviation Administration should--
        (1) give high priority to correcting all 2-digit date-related 
    problems in its computer systems to ensure that those systems 
    continue to operate effectively in the year 2000 and beyond;
        (2) assess immediately the extent of the risk to the operations 
    of the Federal Aviation Administration posed by the problems 
    referred to in paragraph (1), and plan and budget for achieving 
    Year 2000 compliance for all of its mission-critical systems; and
        (3) develop contingency plans for those systems that the 
    Federal Aviation Administration is unable to correct in time.

                                               President of the Senate.

                            Joint Resolution


 
 Congratulating the United States Military Academy at West Point on its 
 bicentennial anniversary, and commending its outstanding contributions 
                             to the Nation.

Whereas establishing a military academy to teach the technical arts of 
  war was a desire of many of our founding fathers, particularly George 
  Washington;
Whereas Congress passed legislation on March 16, 1802, to establish 
  such a military academy to be located at West Point, New York, a site 
  that Washington called the key to the continent because of its 
  strategic importance during the Revolution;
Whereas President Thomas Jefferson signed the legislation establishing 
  the United States Military Academy at West Point, an institution 
  dedicated to promoting scientific education to benefit the Nation and 
  to attracting a diverse array of young citizens to the Nation's 
  military leadership;
Whereas Sylvanus Thayer, who served as Superintendent of the Academy 
  from 1817 to 1833, established the foundation of the Academy's strong 
  academic program, strict adherence to discipline, and emphasis on 
  moral and ethical conduct;
Whereas under Douglas MacArthur's leadership as Superintendent from 
  1919 to 1922, the Academy was modernized to prepare its graduates for 
  the challenges of the 20th century;
Whereas the Academy, the first school in America to teach engineering, 
  produced graduates who were responsible for the construction of the 
  Nation's first railroad lines and many of its early harbor 
  improvements, bridges, roads, and canals;
Whereas Academy graduates introduced engineering education to numerous 
  colleges and universities, and carried out such monumental 
  engineering projects as the construction of the Panama Canal project;
Whereas Academy graduates have also distinguished themselves in the 
  leadership of such innovative scientific research and development 
  projects as the development of atomic bombs in the Manhattan Project 
  during World War II;
Whereas Academy graduates have served with character and distinction in 
  all of America's wars and military actions since the War of 1812;
Whereas 74 Academy graduates have earned the Nation's highest military 
  honor, the Medal of Honor;
Whereas 2 Academy graduates, Ulysses S. Grant and Dwight D. Eisenhower, 
  served both as distinguished general officers and as the President of 
  the United States, and many other graduates have served in all levels 
  of government;
Whereas dozens of Academy graduates have been astronauts, including the 
  Academy graduate who is the first American to walk in space and 2 
  Academy graduates who walked on the moon;
Whereas hundreds of Academy graduates have utilized their talents in 
  the private sector, to provide managerial and technical expertise 
  that is responsible, in part, for nurturing and sustaining a system 
  of enterprise that is admired around the world;
Whereas the Academy has provided an opportunity for men and women of 
  all races, religions, and cultures to receive a college education and 
  to begin a life of service to the Army and the Nation; and
Whereas the motto of the Academy, ``Duty, Honor, Country'', exemplifies 
  the spirit of this Republic: Now, therefore, be it

    Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United 
States of America in Congress assembled, That Congress congratulates 
the United States Military Academy on its bicentennial anniversary, 
recognizes it as an outstanding leadership development institution that 
upholds and promotes the highest virtues of American society, and 
commends all those who have led and taught at the Academy for 
inculcating its 58,000 graduates with moral, ethical, and intellectual 
values and skills that are the foundations for the dedicated service so 
honorably given by those graduates to the Army, the Nation, and friends 
of freedom and liberty around the world for 200 years.

                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.

                            Vice President of the United States and    
                                               President of the Senate.

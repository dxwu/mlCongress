Secretary of the Interior may provide funds to the Bass Lake Joint 
Union Elementary School District and the Mariposa Unified School 
District in the State of California for educational services to 
students--

        (B) who live within or near the park upon real property owned 
    by the United States.
    (2) The Secretary's authority to make payments under this section 
shall terminate if the State of California or local education agencies 
do not continue to provide funding to the schools referred to in 
subsection (a) at per student levels that are no less than the amount 
provided in fiscal year 2005.
    (b) Limitation on Use of Funds.--Payments made under this section 
shall only be used to pay public employees for educational services 
provided in accordance with subsection (a). Payments may not be used 
for construction, construction contracts, or major capital 
improvements.
    (c) Limitation on Amount of Funds.--Payments made under this 
section shall not exceed the lesser of--
        (1) $400,000 in any fiscal year; or
        (2) the amount necessary to provide students described in 
    subsection (a) with educational services that are normally provided 
    and generally available to students who attend public schools 
    elsewhere in the State of California.
    (d) Source of Payments.--(1) Except as otherwise provided in this 
subsection, the Secretary may use funds available to the National Park 
Service from appropriations, donations, or fees.
    (2) Funds from the following sources shall not be used to make 
payments under this section:
        (A) Any law authorizing the collection or expenditure of 
    entrance or use fees at units of the National Park System, 
    including--
            (i) the Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965 (16 
        U.S.C. 460l-4 et seq.); and
            (ii) the Federal Lands Recreation Enhancement Act (16 
        U.S.C. 6801 et seq.).
        (B) Any unexpended receipts collected through--
            (i) the recreational fee demonstration program established 
        under section 315 of the Department of the Interior and Related 
        Agencies Appropriations Act, 1996 (16 U.S.C. 460l-6a note; 
        Public Law 104-134); or
            (ii) the national park passport program established under 
        section 602 of the National Parks Omnibus Management Act of 
        1998 (16 U.S.C. 5992).
        (C) Emergency appropriations for flood recovery at Yosemite 
    National Park.
    (3)(A) The Secretary may use an authorized funding source to make 
payments under this section only if the funding available to Yosemite 
National Park from such source (after subtracting any payments to the 
school districts authorized under this section) is greater than or 
equal to the amount made available to the park for the prior fiscal 
year, or in fiscal year 2005, whichever is greater.
    (B) It is the sense of Congress that any payments made under this 
section should not result in a reduction of funds to Yosemite National 
Park from any specific funding source, and that with respect to 
appropriated funds, funding levels should reflect annual increases in 
the park's operating base funds that are generally made to units of the 
National Park System.

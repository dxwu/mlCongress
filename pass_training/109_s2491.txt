SEC. 2. FINDINGS.

    Congress finds as follows:
            (1) Byron Nelson was a top player in the sport of golf 
        during the World War II era and his accomplishments as a 
        player, a teacher, and commentator are renowned.
            (2) Byron Nelson won 54 career victories, including a

            (4) Sports journalist Bill Nichols recently ranked the 
        greatest seasons on the PGA tour for The Dallas Morning News 
        and picked Roanoke, Texas-resident Byron Nelson's 1945 tour as 
        the greatest season of golf in American history.
            (5) In 1945, Byron Nelson accumulated 18 total victories,

        for 72 holes.
            (7) Byron Nelson is one of only 2 golfers to be named

        85 rounds, and again after his 1945 season.
            (8) The World Golf Hall of Fame honored Byron Nelson in 
        2004 by featuring an exhibit entitled ``Byron Nelson: A

        1937, 1939, 1947 and 1965, and on that last occasion he led the 
        United States Ryder Cup team as team captain to victory over 
        Great Britain.
            (10) Byron Nelson was also a pioneer in the golf business,

            (11) In 1966, True Temper created the ``Iron Byron'' robot 
        to replicate Byron Nelson's swing in order to test the

        and many other manufacturing companies.

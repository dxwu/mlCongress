                               RESOLUTION


 
    Expressing sympathy for the people of the United Kingdom in the 
  aftermath of the deadly terrorist attacks on London on July 7, 2005.

Whereas the United States and a broad international coalition have been engaged 
        in a Global War on Terrorism since the terrorist attacks in Washington, 
        D.C., New York, and Pennsylvania that occurred on September 11, 2001;
Whereas the people and Governments of the United States and the United Kingdom 
        enjoy a deep and enduring friendship undergirded by shared history, 
        language, and values;
Whereas the United Kingdom has been a strong and steadfast ally to the United 
        States through two World Wars, the Cold War, the Gulf War, and the 
        Global War on Terrorism, including the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq;
Whereas terrorists have planned and conducted attacks around the world during 
        the four years after the Global War on Terrorism began in 2001, most 
        notably the bombing of a night club on the Indonesian island of Bali on 
        October 12, 2002 that killed 202 people and injured an additional 209, 
        the bombings of two synagogues and the British Embassy in Istanbul, 
        Turkey in November 2003, in which 56 people were killed and over 450 
        injured, and the bombing of the train system in Madrid, Spain on March 
        11, 2004 that killed more than 190 people and injured approximately 
        1,500;
Whereas on July 7, 2005, a series of four explosions struck the London public 
        transportation system during the morning rush hour, killing at least 49 
        innocent civilians and injuring approximately 700 others;
Whereas a previously unknown terrorist group claimed responsibility for the 
        attacks in the name of al Qaeda;
Whereas the terrorist attacks in London coincided with the opening of the G-8 
        Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, a Summit committed to bringing help and 
        hope to the poorest countries of the world;
Whereas President Bush immediately condemned the terrorist attacks and extended 
        the ``heartfelt condolences'' of the people of the United States to the 
        people of the United Kingdom;
Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair vowed, on behalf of the United Kingdom and the 
        world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, to 
        remain steadfast and strong in the fight against terrorism, stating, 
        ``All of our countries have suffered from the impact of terrorism. Those 
        responsible have no respect for human life. We are united in our resolve 
        to confront and defeat this terrorism that is not an attack on one 
        nation, but all nations and on civilized people everywhere. . . . It's 
        important . . . that those engaged in terrorism realize that our 
        determination to defend our values and our way of life is greater than 
        their determination to cause death and destruction to innocent people in 
        a desire to impose extremism on the world'', and declared, ``We shall 
        prevail, and [the terrorists] shall not'';
Whereas the North Atlantic Council, the governing body of the North Atlantic 
        Treaty Organization, after meeting in an extraordinary session, 
        reaffirmed the determination of the members of the North Atlantic Treaty 
        Organization to combat the scourge of terrorism and defend the values of 
        freedom, tolerance, and democracy using all available means;
Whereas world leaders attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland expressed 
        condolences to the people of the United Kingdom and issued a joint 
        statement to ``condemn utterly these barbaric attacks''; and
Whereas Prime Minister Tony Blair, speaking on behalf of the world leaders 
        attending the G-8 Summit in Gleneagles, Scotland, declared, ``We are 
        united in the resolve'' to defeat terrorism, which is ``not an attack on 
        one nation, but on all nations'': Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That the Senate--
            (1) expresses deepest sympathies and condolences to the 
        people of the United Kingdom and the victims and their families 
        for the heinous terrorist attacks that occurred in London on 
        July 7, 2005;
            (2) condemns these barbaric and unwarranted attacks on the 
        innocent people of London;
            (3) expresses strong and continued solidarity with the 
        people of the United Kingdom and pledges to remain shoulder-to-
        shoulder with the people of the United Kingdom to bring the 
        terrorists responsible for these brutal attacks to justice; and
            (4) calls upon the international community to renew and 
        strengthen efforts to--
                    (A) defeat terrorists by dismantling terrorist 
                networks and exposing the violent and nihilistic 
                ideology of terrorism;
                    (B) increase international cooperation to advance 
                personal and religious freedoms, ethnic and racial 
                tolerance, political liberty and pluralism, and 
                economic prosperity; and
                    (C) combat the social injustice, oppression, 
                poverty, and extremism that breeds terrorism.
                                 <all>

                               RESOLUTION


 
  Expressing the sense of the Senate regarding National Concern About 
                   Young People and Gun Violence Day.

Whereas every day in America, 15 children under the age of 19 are killed with 
        guns;
Whereas in 1994, approximately 70 percent of murder victims aged 15 to 17 were 
        killed with a handgun;
Whereas in 1995, nearly 8 percent of high school students reported having 
        carried a gun in the past 30 days;
Whereas young people are our Nation's most important resource, and we, as a 
        society, have a vested interest in helping children grow from a 
        childhood free from fear and violence into healthy adulthood;
Whereas young people can, by taking responsibility for their own decisions and 
        actions, and by positively influencing the decisions and actions of 
        others, help chart a new and less violent direction for the entire 
        Nation;
Whereas students in every school district in the Nation will be invited to take 
        part in a day of nationwide observance involving millions of their 
        fellow students, and will thereby be empowered to see themselves as 
        significant agents in a wave of positive social change; and
Whereas the observance of this day will give the students the opportunity to 
        make an earnest decision about their future by voluntarily signing the 
        ``Student Pledge Against Gun Violence'', and sincerely promise that the 
        students will never take a gun to school, will never use a gun to settle 
        a dispute, and will use their influence to keep friends from using guns 
        to settle disputes: Now, therefore, be it
    Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--
            (1) November 6, 1997, should be designated as ``National 
        Concern About Young People and Gun Violence Day''; and
            (2) the President should be authorized and requested to 
        issue a proclamation calling upon the school children of the 
        United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies 
        and activities.
                                 <all>
